	abstract = {The rotation of a quantum bit (qubit) is an important step in quantum computation. The rotation is generally performed using a Rabi oscillation. In a direct two-level qubit system, if the Rabi frequency is comparable to its resonance frequency, the rotating wave approximation is not valid, and the Rabi oscillation is accompanied by the so-called Bloch–Siegert oscillation (BSO) that occurs at twice the frequency of the driving field. One implication of the BSO is that for a given interaction time and Rabi frequency, the degree of rotation experienced by the qubit depends explicitly on the initial phase of the driving field. If this effect is not controlled, it leads to an apparent fluctuation in the rotation of the qubit. Here we show that when an off-resonant lambda system is used to realize a two-level qubit, the BSO is inherently negligible, thus eliminating this source of potential error.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing and many research activities associated with it can be seen as a framework for signal processing of low-complexity structures. A cornerstone of the underlying theory is the study of inverse problems with linear or nonlinear measurements. Whether it is sparsity, low-rankness, or other familiar notions of low complexity, the theory addresses necessary and sufficient conditions behind the measurement process to guarantee signal reconstruction with efficient algorithms. This includes consideration of robustness to measurement noise and stability with respect to signal model inaccuracies. This introduction aims to provide an overall view of some of the most important results in this direction. After discussing various examples of low-complexity signal models, two approaches to linear inverse problems are introduced which, respectively, focus on the recovery of individual signals and recovery of all low-complexity signals simultaneously. In particular, we focus on the former setting, giving rise to so-called nonuniform signal recovery problems. We discuss different necessary and sufficient conditions for stable and robust signal reconstruction using convex optimization methods. Appealing to concepts from non-asymptotic random matrix theory, we outline how certain classes of random sensing matrices, which fully govern the measurement process, satisfy certain sufficient conditions for signal recovery. Finally, we review some of the most prominent algorithms for signal recovery proposed in the literature.},

Measurement of APMFs of large axons of worms have been possible due to their size. In the mammalian brain, axon sizes, their numbers and routes, restricts using such functional imaging methods. With a segmented model of mammalian pyramidal neurons, we show that the APMF of intra-axonal currents in the axon hillock are two orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal locations. Expected 2D magnetic field maps of naturalistic spiking activity of a volume of neurons via widefield diamond-nitrogen-vacancy-center-magnetometry were simulated.

It has been difficult, however, to determine precisely what this proposal amounts to. Almost without exception, commentators have held that there are ambiguities in Everett's theory of measurement that result from significant—even embarrassing—omissions. In the present paper, we resist the conclusion that Everett's proposal is incomplete, and we develop a close reading that accounts for apparent oversights. We begin by taking a look at how Everett set up his project—his method and his criterion of success. Illuminating parallels are found between Everett's method and then-contemporary thought regarding inter-theoretic reduction. Also, from unpublished papers and correspondence, we are able to piece together how Everett judged the success of his theory of measurement, which completes our account of his intended contribution to the resolution of the quantum measurement problem.},

In Section 1 a historical introduction to N. M. R. is given. Section 2 deals with the theory of N. M. R. , and the classical approach to it, and concludes with the derivation of the Bloch equations. Section 3 discusses the quantum mechanical approach to the theory of N. M. R. The close proximity of the results of the classical and quantum mechanical approaches is shown. Section 4 deals with the introduction of nuclear density matrices to the theory of N. M. R. Section 5 is mainly concerned with the application of the Bloch equations to reaction kinetics. Chemical shift and multiplet type signal collapses are discussed fully. The last part of this section deals with nuclear magnetization transfer. Section 6 discusses the application of the nuclear density matrix to reaction kinetics. Section 7a contains studies on the hydration of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and diacetyl. The equilibrium constants of the hydration were obtained. The hydrogen ion catalysis of the hydration of acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde was observed, and a rate law obtained for the former case. An explanation of the observed anomalous behaviour of the acetaldehyde hydration is given. Section 7b contains the study of the hydration of pyruvic acid. The equilibrium constant and the rate law of the hydrogen ion catalysis are discussed. Section 8 contains a study made on sodium Na23 magnetic resonance. The dependance of the intensity and half-width on the concentration of sodium hydroxide and chloride is given in detail. Section 9 contains a study of the hydrogen-bonding of some substituted phenols. The results indicate that in an inert solvent, phenols form mainly cyclic trimers. The equilibrium constants were obtained.},

	abstract = {Exact numerical simulations of NMR experiments are often required for the development of new techniques and for the extraction of structural and dynamic information from the spectra. Simulations of solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments can be particularly demanding both computationally and in terms of the programming required to carry them out, even if special simulation software is used. We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these computations. In the present paper, we describe SPINEVOLUTION, a highly optimized computer program that implements the new methodology. The algorithms used in the program will be described separately. Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and multi-spin systems in solids, SPINEVOLUTION is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and optimization of virtually any NMR experiment. The performance of SPINEVOLUTION was compared with that of another recently developed NMR simulation package, SIMPSON. Benchmarked on a series of examples, SPINEVOLUTION was consistently found to be orders of magnitude faster. At the time of publication, the program is available gratis for non-commercial use.},

	abstract = {The theoretical transition energies of a spin 3/2 under a combination of quadrupolar and Zeeman interactions are mapped out as a function of magnetic field. This allows us to follow the spectroscopy continuously from zero magnetic field (NQR, nuclear quadrupole resonance) through to high magnetic field (quadrupole-perturbed NMR). This calculation is made possible by a theoretical approach that makes maximum use of the angular momentum properties of the spin system. In this approach, the detailed form of the spin operators are not required, only their angular momentum quantum numbers. No commutators need be evaluated, and the method is easily coded for computer calculation. Application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules means that there are only two nonzero reduced matrix elements that are needed for a spin 3/2, and there are explicit formulae for them. In looking at the transition energies, the crucial parameter is the orientation of the quadrupole tensor to the magnetic field. If the angle is nonzero, then the quantization of the spins must shift. At zero field, the quantization is defined by the electric field gradient tensor, which is molecule-fixed at some arbitrary angle to the magnetic field. This direction of quantization must change as the magnetic field increases, to lie close to the z axis at high field. In the region where the two interactions are comparable, all the familiar rules break down and the response is highly nonlinear. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast 3D MRI simulator for arbitrary k-space sampling using a graphical processing unit (GPU) and demonstrate its performance by comparing simulation and experimental results in a real MRI system.Materials and Methods: A fast 3D MRI simulator using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was developed using C++ and the CUDA 8.0 platform (NVIDIA Corporation). The unique advantage of this simulator was that it could use the same pulse sequence as used in the experiment. The performance of the MRI simulator was measured using two GTX 1080 GPUs and 3D Cones sequences. The MRI simulation results for 3D non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like 3D Cones sequences using a numerical 3D phantom were compared with the experimental results obtained with a real MRI system and a real 3D phantom.Results: The performance of the MRI simulator was about 3800–4900 gigaflops for 128- to 4-shot 3D Cones sequences with 2563 voxels, which was about 60\% of the performance of the previous MRI simulator optimized for Cartesian sampling calculated for a Cartesian sampling gradient-echo sequence with 2563 voxels. The effects of the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, radio-frequency field inhomogeneity, gradient field nonlinearity, and fast repetition times on the MR images were reproduced in the simulated images as observed in the experimental images.Conclusion: The 3D MRI simulator developed for arbitrary k-space sampling optimized using GPUs is a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of advanced imaging sequences including both Cartesian and non-Cartesian k-space sampling.},

The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator.

Much of the motivation for exploring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in the past decade has been for their potential as a solid-state alternative to trapped ions for quantum computing. In this area, the NV center has exceeded expectations and even shown an unprecedented capability to perform certain quantum processing and storage operations at room temperature. The ability to operate in ambient conditions, combined with the atom-like magnetic Zeeman sensitivity, has also led to intensive investigation of NV centers as nanoscale magnetometers. Thus, aside from room-temperature solid-state quantum computers, the NV could also be used to image individual spins in biological systems, eventually leading to a new level of understanding of biomolecular interactions in living cells.},

However, it also marked, the 20th anniversary of the first observation of Bose–Einstein condensation in atomic vapors by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle. This discovery could be considered as one of the greatest achievements of quantum optics that has triggered an avalanche of further seminal discoveries and achievements. For this reason we devote this essay for the focus issue on ‘Quantum Optics in the International Year of Light’ to the recent revolutionary developments in quantum optics at the frontiers of all physics: atomic physics, molecular physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science. We follow here the lines of the introduction to our book ‘Ultracold atoms in optical lattices: Simulating quantum many-body systems’ (Lewenstein et al 2012 Ultracold Atoms in Optical Lattices: Simulating Quantum Many-body Systems (Oxford: University Press)), and to a lesser extent the review article M Lewenstein et al (2007 Adv. Phys. 56 243). The book, however, was published in 2012, and many things has happened since then—the present essay is therefore upgraded to include the latest developments.},

	title = {Spinor {Bose}-{Einstein} condensates in magnetic field gradients},
	url = {/articles/thesis/Spinor_Bose-Einstein_condensates_in_magnetic_field_gradients/4697395/1},
	abstract = {Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are multi-component superfluids with magnetic interactions, formed from dilute gases of atoms in the Zeeman sublevels mF of a single hyperfine ground state F. Spinor BECs are inherently magnetic quantum objects, and exhibit a multitude of features such as spin domains, magnon excitations, and distinct magnetic phases. At the heart of the magnetic nature of a spinor BEC is the spin-dependent collisional interaction c, which determines the overall magnetic behaviour of the superfluid. In conjunction with the quadratic Zeeman shift q, the magnitude and sign of c give rise to an intricate magnetic phase diagram. The magnetic phase of a spinor BEC is tunable, and c and q are the knobs. In addition to realising quantum simulators of magnetism, spinor BECs are also precise magnetic sensors. Atomic magnetometry measures the Larmor precession frequency of atoms, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength. The sensitivity of an atomic magnetometer is principally dependent on the duration of the measurement (interrogation time) and number of atoms participating in the measurement. BECs are highly suitable as atomic magnetometers, allowing for long interrogation times and high atomic density, with microscopic sensor volumes. The latter is an important consideration, as measurement of small magnetic sources demand equally microscopic sensors. Established forms of magnetometry (such as warm vapour magnetometers) use large sensing volumes and are not trivially miniaturised. The exquisite sensitivity of a spinor BEC to magnetic fields becomes a liability when one studies low energy ({\textasciitilde} 1 Hz) spinor physics over long evolution times (100 ms) in a typical laboratory environment. To first order, the spin-collisional interaction is independent of the magnetic field. However, spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields are problematic, exerting mechanical forces on the magnetically sensitive spin components, suppressing spin collisions and possibly introducing relaxation mechanisms that confound the observation of intrinsic equilibration. Precise characterisation of magnetic field gradients and their cancellation is thus of paramount importance. In this thesis, the interaction of a spinor BEC with its environment is studied. The construction, operation and optimisation of a BEC machine is described in detail, as well as the quantum state preparation and control techniques used. Spin-mixing collisions were studied by observing population oscillations, the characteristic hallmark of such coherent phenomena. The observed population dynamics showed strong evidence of the deleterious effects of magnetic field gradients. A series of experiments were performed using spin-echo pulse sequences to decouple the evolving spinor condensate from the inhomogeneous magnetic environment with encouraging results, but which posed further questions. The fidelity of spin-echo pulses in the strong radiative coupling regime was also studied. Spinor condensates were then employed as sensitive magnetometers to characterise the magnetic landscape they inhabit. A new method of measuring magnetic field gradients was developed, using a pair of spinor BECs separated in space that are simultaneously addressed by a Ramsey interferometry sequence. Combined with a re-orientable magnetic bias field, the resulting gradiometer was used to measure the magnetic field gradient tensor in vacuo. This scheme can be extended to realise a high-precision vector co-magnetometer, with spatiotemporal sensitivity comparable to established forms of magnetometry. Vector light shifts (VLSs) are optically-induced energy shifts that result in effective magnetic fields, which in our case originate from the laser beams used to trap the atoms. The VLS vanishes for purely linearly polarised light, which is experimentally difficult to obtain in vacuo. Small elliptical polarisation imperfections originating from birefringent optics and the glass vacuum cell result in a non-zero shift that contaminates magnetometry measurements. The VLS is spatially varying due to the intensity gradient of the trapping light. Due to gravitational sag of the trapping potential, the spatial variation of the VLS is accentuated, resulting in an effective magnetic field gradient that contributes to dephasing and component separation. The simultaneous Ramsey interferometry experiments are then adapted to measure the VLS-induced Zeeman shift and diagnose its elimination. Up to 99.96\% of the VLS is eliminated using this method, and extensions to the technique are described.},

The quantum properties of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) defect in diamond can be used as an atomic compass needle that is sensitive to tiny variations in magnetic field. Schmitt et al. and Boss et al. successfully enhanced this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude (see the Perspective by Jordan). They applied a sequence of pulses to the NV center, the timing of which was set by and compared with a highly stable oscillator. This allowed them to measure the frequency of an oscillating magnetic field (megahertz bandwidth) with submillihertz resolution. Such enhanced precision measurement could be applied, for example, to improve nuclear magnetic resonance-based imaging protocols of single molecules.
Science, this issue p. 832, p. 837; see also p. 802
Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 104 for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.

	abstract = {This thesis presents a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with the paramagnetic Faraday effect. This quantum-photon interface couples the spin of the BEC to the polarisation of an off-resonant laser, which in a magnetic field gradient allows a 1D density profile of the BEC to be reconstructed. As opposed to conventional imaging techniques that are destructive or diffraction limited, this technique is minimally destructive to the BEC and not diffraction limited. Multishot in situ imaging of a single condensate is therefore possible, paving the way for time-resolved studies and 2D/3D reconstructions. A theoretical model for Faraday imaging is developed using the tensor polarisability formalism for the atom-light interaction, and the signal-to-noise ratio is derived. Resolution limits induced by Stern-Gerlach separation are considered, encouraging rapid measurements with strong magnetic field gradients. Analysing the trapping potential reveals that the `magic-zero' wavelength 790nm produces no dipole force and enables a tightly focused probe laser to be used without perturbing the trap. Polarisation-maintaining fibers were seen to impart large fluctuations depending on the incident polarisation, which were minimised. The broad diode laser emission background is seen to reduce the lifetime of the BEC, which was corrected with an interference filter. Short-time Fourier transforms are used to process the photodetected signal, showing the evolution of the polarisation rotation frequency and amplitude. Frequency-modulation is observed at the power line frequency, corresponding to magnetic field fluctuations induced by nearby equipment. Birefringence of optical elements results in elliptical polarisation of the probe and an effective magnetic field, which is cancelled using a quarter-waveplate. The quadratic Zeeman effect causes rapid amplitude modulation, and is eliminated by applying a microwave dressing field. Radiative spin echo is achieved in a magnetic field gradient, proving that dephasing is coherent, and that multishot imaging possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed on a partially-evaporated atom cloud, distinguishing the thermal and condensed fractions. A split dipole trap is used to create two spatially separated BECs, which are individually resolved during MRI. The resolution is only limited by the strength of the applied magnetic field gradient, and is not subject to the diffraction limit. Custom coils will enable MRI of condensates at the sub-micron scale.},

	abstract = {To detect a stealth target, one may directly probe it with a single photon and analyze the reflected signals. The efficiency of such conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the classical limits. The question is what is the optimal signal state for achieving the detection limit? Here, we address this question in a general discrete model, and derive a complete set of analytic solutions. For one-shot detection, the parameter space can be classified into three distinct regions, in the form of a “phase diagram” for both conventional and quantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is less than some critical value, all received signals become useless, which is true even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a region where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional illumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an entanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the environmental noise state and is, surprisingly, independent of the occurrence probability and the reflectivity of the object. The entanglement of the ideal probe state increases with the entropy of the environment; it becomes more entangled as the temperature of the environment increases. Finally, we show that the performance advantage cannot be fully characterized by any measure of quantum correlation, unless the environment is a complete mixed state.},

The method scales the matrix by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1, computes a Padé approximant to the matrix exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give a new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Padé approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Padé approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37\% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Padé approximation to the function x coth(x).

We consider both traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of problems in the literature) as well as the recently developed commutator-free Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) based systems. We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of 10 in the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of more efficient numerical methods.},

	abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be signiﬁcantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

This paper describes an implementation for graphics processing units (GPU) of hard thresholding, iterative hard thresholding, normalized iterative hard thresholding, hard thresholding pursuit, and a two-stage thresholding algorithm based on compressive sampling matching pursuit and subspace pursuit. The GPU acceleration of the former bottleneck, namely the matrix–vector multiplications, transfers a significant portion of the computational burden to the identification of the support set. The software solves high-dimensional problems in fractions of a second which permits large-scale testing at dimensions currently unavailable in the literature. The GPU implementations exhibit up to 70\$\${\textbackslash}times \$\$×acceleration over standard Matlab central processing unit implementations using automatic multi-threading.},

As an application, we discuss the implementation of exponential integrators for different classes of problems in a single and multi GPU setup (up to 4 GPUs). We further show that for stencil based methods such parallelization can be done very efficiently, while for some unstructured matrices the parallelization to multiple GPUs is severely limited by the throughput of the PCIe bus.},

	abstract = {Approximate resolution of linear systems of differential equations with varying coefficients is a recurrent problem, shared by a number of scientific and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an elegant setting to build up approximate exponential representations of the solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the important additional property of preserving, at any order, certain symmetries of the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series, generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third, to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus expansion, in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard numerical integrators. We buttress this issue with a revision of the wide range of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature.},

	abstract = {We describe LLVM (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},
