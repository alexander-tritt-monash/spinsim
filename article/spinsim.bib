	abstract = {Magnetic fields from neuronal action potentials (APs) pass largely unperturbed through biological tissue, allowing magnetic measurements of AP dynamics to be performed extracellularly or even outside intact organisms. To date, however, magnetic techniques for sensing neuronal activity have either operated at the macroscale with coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution—e.g., magnetic resonance imaging methods and magnetoencephalography—or been restricted to biophysics studies of excised neurons probed with cryogenic or bulky detectors that do not provide single-neuron spatial resolution and are not scalable to functional networks or intact organisms. Here, we show that AP magnetic sensing can be realized with both single-neuron sensitivity and intact organism applicability using optically probed nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in diamond, operated under ambient conditions and with the NV diamond sensor in close proximity (∼10 µm) to the biological sample. We demonstrate this method for excised single neurons from marine worm and squid, and then exterior to intact, optically opaque marine worms for extended periods and with no observed adverse effect on the animal. NV diamond magnetometry is noninvasive and label-free and does not cause photodamage. The method provides precise measurement of AP waveforms from individual neurons, as well as magnetic field correlates of the AP conduction velocity, and directly determines the AP propagation direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic field vector.},

	abstract = {The rotation of a quantum bit (qubit) is an important step in quantum computation. The rotation is generally performed using a Rabi oscillation. In a direct two-level qubit system, if the Rabi frequency is comparable to its resonance frequency, the rotating wave approximation is not valid, and the Rabi oscillation is accompanied by the so-called Bloch–Siegert oscillation (BSO) that occurs at twice the frequency of the driving field. One implication of the BSO is that for a given interaction time and Rabi frequency, the degree of rotation experienced by the qubit depends explicitly on the initial phase of the driving field. If this effect is not controlled, it leads to an apparent fluctuation in the rotation of the qubit. Here we show that when an off-resonant lambda system is used to realize a two-level qubit, the BSO is inherently negligible, thus eliminating this source of potential error.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing and many research activities associated with it can be seen as a framework for signal processing of low-complexity structures. A cornerstone of the underlying theory is the study of inverse problems with linear or nonlinear measurements. Whether it is sparsity, low-rankness, or other familiar notions of low complexity, the theory addresses necessary and sufficient conditions behind the measurement process to guarantee signal reconstruction with efficient algorithms. This includes consideration of robustness to measurement noise and stability with respect to signal model inaccuracies. This introduction aims to provide an overall view of some of the most important results in this direction. After discussing various examples of low-complexity signal models, two approaches to linear inverse problems are introduced which, respectively, focus on the recovery of individual signals and recovery of all low-complexity signals simultaneously. In particular, we focus on the former setting, giving rise to so-called nonuniform signal recovery problems. We discuss different necessary and sufficient conditions for stable and robust signal reconstruction using convex optimization methods. Appealing to concepts from non-asymptotic random matrix theory, we outline how certain classes of random sensing matrices, which fully govern the measurement process, satisfy certain sufficient conditions for signal recovery. Finally, we review some of the most prominent algorithms for signal recovery proposed in the literature.},

With a segmented model of mammalian pyramidal neurons, we show that the APMF of intra-axonal currents in the axon hillock are two orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal locations. Expected 2D magnetic field maps of naturalistic spiking activity of a volume of neurons via widefield diamond-nitrogen-vacancy-center-magnetometry were simulated.

It has been difficult, however, to determine precisely what this proposal amounts to. Almost without exception, commentators have held that there are ambiguities in Everett's theory of measurement that result from significant—even embarrassing—omissions. In the present paper, we resist the conclusion that Everett's proposal is incomplete, and we develop a close reading that accounts for apparent oversights. We begin by taking a look at how Everett set up his project—his method and his criterion of success. Illuminating parallels are found between Everett's method and then-contemporary thought regarding inter-theoretic reduction. Also, from unpublished papers and correspondence, we are able to piece together how Everett judged the success of his theory of measurement, which completes our account of his intended contribution to the resolution of the quantum measurement problem.},

In Section 1 a historical introduction to N. M. R. is given. Section 2 deals with the theory of N. M. R. , and the classical approach to it, and concludes with the derivation of the Bloch equations. Section 3 discusses the quantum mechanical approach to the theory of N. M. R. The close proximity of the results of the classical and quantum mechanical approaches is shown. Section 4 deals with the introduction of nuclear density matrices to the theory of N. M. R. Section 5 is mainly concerned with the application of the Bloch equations to reaction kinetics. Chemical shift and multiplet type signal collapses are discussed fully. The last part of this section deals with nuclear magnetization transfer. Section 6 discusses the application of the nuclear density matrix to reaction kinetics. Section 7a contains studies on the hydration of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and diacetyl. The equilibrium constants of the hydration were obtained. The hydrogen ion catalysis of the hydration of acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde was observed, and a rate law obtained for the former case. An explanation of the observed anomalous behaviour of the acetaldehyde hydration is given. Section 7b contains the study of the hydration of pyruvic acid. The equilibrium constant and the rate law of the hydrogen ion catalysis are discussed. Section 8 contains a study made on sodium Na23 magnetic resonance. The dependance of the intensity and half-width on the concentration of sodium hydroxide and chloride is given in detail. Section 9 contains a study of the hydrogen-bonding of some substituted phenols. The results indicate that in an inert solvent, phenols form mainly cyclic trimers. The equilibrium constants were obtained.},

	abstract = {Exact numerical simulations of NMR experiments are often required for the development of new techniques and for the extraction of structural and dynamic information from the spectra. Simulations of solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments can be particularly demanding both computationally and in terms of the programming required to carry them out, even if special simulation software is used. We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these computations. In the present paper, we describe SPINEVOLUTION, a highly optimized computer program that implements the new methodology. The algorithms used in the program will be described separately. Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and multi-spin systems in solids, SPINEVOLUTION is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and optimization of virtually any NMR experiment. The performance of SPINEVOLUTION was compared with that of another recently developed NMR simulation package, SIMPSON. Benchmarked on a series of examples, SPINEVOLUTION was consistently found to be orders of magnitude faster. At the time of publication, the program is available gratis for non-commercial use.},

	abstract = {The theoretical transition energies of a spin 3/2 under a combination of quadrupolar and Zeeman interactions are mapped out as a function of magnetic field. This allows us to follow the spectroscopy continuously from zero magnetic field (NQR, nuclear quadrupole resonance) through to high magnetic field (quadrupole-perturbed NMR). This calculation is made possible by a theoretical approach that makes maximum use of the angular momentum properties of the spin system. In this approach, the detailed form of the spin operators are not required, only their angular momentum quantum numbers. No commutators need be evaluated, and the method is easily coded for computer calculation. Application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules means that there are only two nonzero reduced matrix elements that are needed for a spin 3/2, and there are explicit formulae for them. In looking at the transition energies, the crucial parameter is the orientation of the quadrupole tensor to the magnetic field. If the angle is nonzero, then the quantization of the spins must shift. At zero field, the quantization is defined by the electric field gradient tensor, which is molecule-fixed at some arbitrary angle to the magnetic field. This direction of quantization must change as the magnetic field increases, to lie close to the z axis at high field. In the region where the two interactions are comparable, all the familiar rules break down and the response is highly nonlinear. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast 3D MRI simulator for arbitrary k-space sampling using a graphical processing unit (GPU) and demonstrate its performance by comparing simulation and experimental results in a real MRI system.Materials and Methods: A fast 3D MRI simulator using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was developed using C++ and the CUDA 8.0 platform (NVIDIA Corporation). The unique advantage of this simulator was that it could use the same pulse sequence as used in the experiment. The performance of the MRI simulator was measured using two GTX 1080 GPUs and 3D Cones sequences. The MRI simulation results for 3D non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like 3D Cones sequences using a numerical 3D phantom were compared with the experimental results obtained with a real MRI system and a real 3D phantom.Results: The performance of the MRI simulator was about 3800–4900 gigaflops for 128- to 4-shot 3D Cones sequences with 2563 voxels, which was about 60\% of the performance of the previous MRI simulator optimized for Cartesian sampling calculated for a Cartesian sampling gradient-echo sequence with 2563 voxels. The effects of the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, radio-frequency field inhomogeneity, gradient field nonlinearity, and fast repetition times on the MR images were reproduced in the simulated images as observed in the experimental images.Conclusion: The 3D MRI simulator developed for arbitrary k-space sampling optimized using GPUs is a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of advanced imaging sequences including both Cartesian and non-Cartesian k-space sampling.},

The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful MRI simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for MRI research and development.},

Much of the motivation for exploring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in the past decade has been for their potential as a solid-state alternative to trapped ions for quantum computing. In this area, the NV center has exceeded expectations and even shown an unprecedented capability to perform certain quantum processing and storage operations at room temperature. The ability to operate in ambient conditions, combined with the atom-like magnetic Zeeman sensitivity, has also led to intensive investigation of NV centers as nanoscale magnetometers. Thus, aside from room-temperature solid-state quantum computers, the NV could also be used to image individual spins in biological systems, eventually leading to a new level of understanding of biomolecular interactions in living cells.},

	title = {Spinor {Bose}-{Einstein} condensates in magnetic field gradients},
	url = {/articles/thesis/Spinor_Bose-Einstein_condensates_in_magnetic_field_gradients/4697395/1},
	abstract = {Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are multi-component superfluids with magnetic interactions, formed from dilute gases of atoms in the Zeeman sublevels mF of a single hyperfine ground state F. Spinor BECs are inherently magnetic quantum objects, and exhibit a multitude of features such as spin domains, magnon excitations, and distinct magnetic phases. At the heart of the magnetic nature of a spinor BEC is the spin-dependent collisional interaction c, which determines the overall magnetic behaviour of the superfluid. In conjunction with the quadratic Zeeman shift q, the magnitude and sign of c give rise to an intricate magnetic phase diagram. The magnetic phase of a spinor BEC is tunable, and c and q are the knobs. In addition to realising quantum simulators of magnetism, spinor BECs are also precise magnetic sensors. Atomic magnetometry measures the Larmor precession frequency of atoms, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength. The sensitivity of an atomic magnetometer is principally dependent on the duration of the measurement (interrogation time) and number of atoms participating in the measurement. BECs are highly suitable as atomic magnetometers, allowing for long interrogation times and high atomic density, with microscopic sensor volumes. The latter is an important consideration, as measurement of small magnetic sources demand equally microscopic sensors. Established forms of magnetometry (such as warm vapour magnetometers) use large sensing volumes and are not trivially miniaturised. The exquisite sensitivity of a spinor BEC to magnetic fields becomes a liability when one studies low energy ({\textasciitilde} 1 Hz) spinor physics over long evolution times (100 ms) in a typical laboratory environment. To first order, the spin-collisional interaction is independent of the magnetic field. However, spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields are problematic, exerting mechanical forces on the magnetically sensitive spin components, suppressing spin collisions and possibly introducing relaxation mechanisms that confound the observation of intrinsic equilibration. Precise characterisation of magnetic field gradients and their cancellation is thus of paramount importance. In this thesis, the interaction of a spinor BEC with its environment is studied. The construction, operation and optimisation of a BEC machine is described in detail, as well as the quantum state preparation and control techniques used. Spin-mixing collisions were studied by observing population oscillations, the characteristic hallmark of such coherent phenomena. The observed population dynamics showed strong evidence of the deleterious effects of magnetic field gradients. A series of experiments were performed using spin-echo pulse sequences to decouple the evolving spinor condensate from the inhomogeneous magnetic environment with encouraging results, but which posed further questions. The fidelity of spin-echo pulses in the strong radiative coupling regime was also studied. Spinor condensates were then employed as sensitive magnetometers to characterise the magnetic landscape they inhabit. A new method of measuring magnetic field gradients was developed, using a pair of spinor BECs separated in space that are simultaneously addressed by a Ramsey interferometry sequence. Combined with a re-orientable magnetic bias field, the resulting gradiometer was used to measure the magnetic field gradient tensor in vacuo. This scheme can be extended to realise a high-precision vector co-magnetometer, with spatiotemporal sensitivity comparable to established forms of magnetometry. Vector light shifts (VLSs) are optically-induced energy shifts that result in effective magnetic fields, which in our case originate from the laser beams used to trap the atoms. The VLS vanishes for purely linearly polarised light, which is experimentally difficult to obtain in vacuo. Small elliptical polarisation imperfections originating from birefringent optics and the glass vacuum cell result in a non-zero shift that contaminates magnetometry measurements. The VLS is spatially varying due to the intensity gradient of the trapping light. Due to gravitational sag of the trapping potential, the spatial variation of the VLS is accentuated, resulting in an effective magnetic field gradient that contributes to dephasing and component separation. The simultaneous Ramsey interferometry experiments are then adapted to measure the VLS-induced Zeeman shift and diagnose its elimination. Up to 99.96\% of the VLS is eliminated using this method, and extensions to the technique are described.},

The quantum properties of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) defect in diamond can be used as an atomic compass needle that is sensitive to tiny variations in magnetic field. Schmitt et al. and Boss et al. successfully enhanced this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude (see the Perspective by Jordan). They applied a sequence of pulses to the NV center, the timing of which was set by and compared with a highly stable oscillator. This allowed them to measure the frequency of an oscillating magnetic field (megahertz bandwidth) with submillihertz resolution. Such enhanced precision measurement could be applied, for example, to improve nuclear magnetic resonance-based imaging protocols of single molecules.
Science, this issue p. 832, p. 837; see also p. 802
Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 104 for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.

	abstract = {This thesis presents a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with the paramagnetic Faraday effect. This quantum-photon interface couples the spin of the BEC to the polarisation of an off-resonant laser, which in a magnetic field gradient allows a 1D density profile of the BEC to be reconstructed. As opposed to conventional imaging techniques that are destructive or diffraction limited, this technique is minimally destructive to the BEC and not diffraction limited. Multishot in situ imaging of a single condensate is therefore possible, paving the way for time-resolved studies and 2D/3D reconstructions. A theoretical model for Faraday imaging is developed using the tensor polarisability formalism for the atom-light interaction, and the signal-to-noise ratio is derived. Resolution limits induced by Stern-Gerlach separation are considered, encouraging rapid measurements with strong magnetic field gradients. Analysing the trapping potential reveals that the `magic-zero' wavelength 790nm produces no dipole force and enables a tightly focused probe laser to be used without perturbing the trap. Polarisation-maintaining fibers were seen to impart large fluctuations depending on the incident polarisation, which were minimised. The broad diode laser emission background is seen to reduce the lifetime of the BEC, which was corrected with an interference filter. Short-time Fourier transforms are used to process the photodetected signal, showing the evolution of the polarisation rotation frequency and amplitude. Frequency-modulation is observed at the power line frequency, corresponding to magnetic field fluctuations induced by nearby equipment. Birefringence of optical elements results in elliptical polarisation of the probe and an effective magnetic field, which is cancelled using a quarter-waveplate. The quadratic Zeeman effect causes rapid amplitude modulation, and is eliminated by applying a microwave dressing field. Radiative spin echo is achieved in a magnetic field gradient, proving that dephasing is coherent, and that multishot imaging possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed on a partially-evaporated atom cloud, distinguishing the thermal and condensed fractions. A split dipole trap is used to create two spatially separated BECs, which are individually resolved during MRI. The resolution is only limited by the strength of the applied magnetic field gradient, and is not subject to the diffraction limit. Custom coils will enable MRI of condensates at the sub-micron scale.},

	abstract = {To detect a stealth target, one may directly probe it with a single photon and analyze the reflected signals. The efficiency of such conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the classical limits. The question is what is the optimal signal state for achieving the detection limit? Here, we address this question in a general discrete model, and derive a complete set of analytic solutions. For one-shot detection, the parameter space can be classified into three distinct regions, in the form of a “phase diagram” for both conventional and quantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is less than some critical value, all received signals become useless, which is true even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a region where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional illumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an entanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the environmental noise state and is, surprisingly, independent of the occurrence probability and the reflectivity of the object. The entanglement of the ideal probe state increases with the entropy of the environment; it becomes more entangled as the temperature of the environment increases. Finally, we show that the performance advantage cannot be fully characterized by any measure of quantum correlation, unless the environment is a complete mixed state.},

The method scales the matrix by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1, computes a Padé approximant to the matrix exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give a new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Padé approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Padé approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37\% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Padé approximation to the function x coth(x).

	abstract = {This paper deals with the stability of some one-step methods for computing the action of a matrix exponential on a vector, i.e. eAb, where A is an n-by-n matrix and b is a vector of dimension n. The methods are based on certain assumptions made for the case that A is a matrix having sufficiently small norm. If the norm of A is larger, a fixed step size is used to perform a scaling of A. An analysis of the roundoff error of the computed eAb shows that these methods are backward stable if A is Hermitian, and forward stable if, for example, A is skew-Hermitian or if A is real and essentially nonnegative and b is real and nonnegative. In addition, an upper bound on the forward error of the computed eAb is obtained for all A and b. This bound, which is expressed in terms of the condition number, is evaluated for several examples of the data. The results of this paper partly apply to the algorithm proposed by Al-Mohy and Higham (2011) for computing eAb.},

	abstract = {In the present paper we consider numerical methods to solve the discrete Schrödinger equation with a time dependent Hamiltonian (motivated by problems encountered in the study of spin systems). We will consider both short-range interactions, which lead to evolution equations involving sparse matrices, and long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings show very different computational characteristics. We use Magnus integrators for time integration and employ a framework based on Leja interpolation to compute the resulting action of the matrix exponential. We consider both traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of problems in the literature) as well as the recently developed commutator-free Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) based systems. We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of 10 in the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of more efficient numerical methods.},

However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be signiﬁcantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

The GPU acceleration of the former bottleneck, namely the matrix–vector multiplications, transfers a significant portion of the computational burden to the identification of the support set. The software solves high-dimensional problems in fractions of a second which permits large-scale testing at dimensions currently unavailable in the literature.

	abstract = {Approximate resolution of linear systems of differential equations with varying coefficients is a recurrent problem, shared by a number of scientific and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an elegant setting to build up approximate exponential representations of the solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the important additional property of preserving, at any order, certain symmetries of the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series, generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third, to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus expansion, in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard numerical integrators. We buttress this issue with a revision of the wide range of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature.},

The effort of quantum tomography--the reconstruction of states and processes of a quantum device--scales unfavourably: state-of-the-art systems can no longer be characterized. Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by reconstructing states from incomplete data. Here we present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven-qubit system--a topological colour code prepared in a trapped ion architecture. We are in the highly incomplete--127 Pauli basis measurement settings--and highly noisy--100 repetitions each--regime. Originally, compressed sensing was advocated for states with few non-zero eigenvalues. We argue that low-rank estimates are appropriate in general since statistical noise enables reliable reconstruction of only the leading eigenvectors. The remaining eigenvectors behave consistently with a random-matrix model that carries no information about the true state.},

Compressed sensing, a machinery derived from the theory of signal processing, has emerged as a feasible tool to perform robust and significantly more resource-economical quantum state tomography for intermediate-sized quantum systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of compressed sensing tomography in the regime in which tomographically complete data is available with reliable statistics from experimental observations of a multi-mode photonic architecture. Due to the fact that the data is known with high statistical significance, we are in a position to systematically explore the quality of reconstruction depending on the number of employed measurement settings, randomly selected from the complete set of data, and on different model assumptions. We present and test a complete prescription to perform efficient compressed sensing and are able to reliably use notions of model selection and cross validation to account for experimental imperfections and finite counting statistics. Thus, we establish compressed sensing as an effective tool for quantum state tomography, specifically suited for photonic systems.},

Random measurement matrices satisfying the restricted isometry property can be used efficiently to reconstruct signals that are sparse in any basis.

A model based on the Bloch equations is used to analyze the NV center's response time, τ, during continuous optical and microwave irradiation, and τ−1 is shown to be a weighted average of T1−1 and T2−1, where T1 and T2 are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times of the electron spin during optical irradiation. We measured a maximum detection bandwidth of ∼1.6 MHz with optical excitation intensity of ∼2.3 MW/cm2, limited by the available optical power. The sensitivity of the NV ensemble for continuous-wave magnetometry in the presence of photon shot noise is analyzed. Two detection schemes are compared, one involving modulation of the fluorescence by an oscillating magnetic field while the microwave frequency is held constant, and the other involving double modulation of the fluorescence when the microwave frequency is modulated during the detection. For the first of these methods, we measure a sensitivity of 4.6 ± 0.3 nT/√Hz, unprecedented in a detector with this active volume of ∼10 μm3 and close to the photon-shot-noise limit of our experiment. The measured bandwidth and sensitivity of our device should allow detection of micro-scale NMR signals with microfluidic devices.},

	abstract = {We describe LLVM (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

	title = {Beyond the {Rotating} {Wave} {Approximation} in a {Radiofrequency}-dressed {Spin}-1/2 {System}},
	abstract = {A radiofrequency-dressed (RF) spin-1/2 system provides a model to predict and understand the
behaviour of RF-dressed spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). RF-dressed spinor BECs are
theorised to be highly sensitive quantum sensors, with the potential to measure weak oscillating
magnetic fields such as those produced by neuron impulses. Through this project, we aimed to
investigate whether taking the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was a sufficiently thorough
treatment for laboratory frame BEC systems and if not, to determine whether error contributions
were sufficient to impact detection of weak signals. Through simulation of the RF-dressed spin-1/2
system in the laboratory frame at three different Rabi frequencies of Ω = 10 kHz, Ω = 5 kHz and
Ω = 1 kHz, application of mathematical equivalents to the experimental process of demodulation
were performed on the simulated system measurements, with both in-phase and in-quadrature errors
appearing. Further analysis led to induced detunings of ∆10 = 34.902(5) Hz, ∆5 = 8.7222(8) Hz and
∆1 = 0.348988(5) Hz that were shown to directly correlate with the first-order Bloch-Siegert shift,
a beyond-RWA effect. Application of a weak signal to the system then indicated that this detuning
introduced was sufficiently weak that signal detection was unaffected for resonant signals as weak
as Ω2 = 10 Hz, with indications weaker signals would still remain unaffected. These results indicate
beyond-RWA effects are non-negligible but insufficient to affect detection of resonant weak signals,
indicating future applications to neuron impulse detection may remain unaffected by beyond-RWA
effects.},

	url = {/articles/thesis/Precise_engineering_of_the_Bose-Einstein_condensate_wavefunction_using_magnetic_resonance_control/4719724/1},
	abstract = {To engineer the wavefunction of a Bose–Einstein condensate is to exert control over both the density and phase of the Bose–Einstein condensate order parameter. Having the ability to engineer the condensate order parameter down to the smallest length scale relevant to condensate dynamics—the healing length scale—would enable the study of new combinations of topological defects and may pave the way to using Bose–Einstein condensates as versatile, precise quantum simulators. In this thesis, we present a new wavefunction engineering technique which reaches the sub-optical healing length scale. Influenced by magnetic resonance imaging, we name this technique magnetic resonance control. This technique uses time-varying coupling between internal spin states of a spinor Bose–Einstein condensate within a magnetic field gradient to address spatial regions of the condensate, enabling control over both the phase and the density of the condensate order parameter down to the healing length scale. Techniques already exist to engineer condensate wavefunctions, but not with such a fine degree of control. These techniques primarily rely on either the intensity variation of a laser beam, which limits the resolution to the diffraction limit (larger than the typically sub-optical healing length scale), or the adiabatic inversion of a magnetic trapping potential, which can not be easily changed to produce a variety of structures in the condensate wavefunction. To develop our magnetic resonance control technique, we simulate a spinor condensate in one dimension with time-dependent coupling between spin states and time-dependent external magnetic field gradients using the Gross–Pitaevskii equation. We show that magnetic resonance control can engineer a single black soliton using experimentally feasible parameters. A black soliton is an ideal target state to select for this demonstration because engineering such a state requires control over both the phase and density of the condensate with healing-length resolution. We demonstrate that magnetic resonance control can be extended to engineer more complicated target states by simulating the creation of multiple solitons in a condensate, with control over the initial positions and trajectories of the solitons. When magnetic resonance control is applied to Bose–Einstein condensates in the laboratory, it will be necessary to have an imaging system capable of resolving the fine structures created. As an alternative to high-cost, custom-manufactured lenses, and in-vacuum optical systems, I have designed and bench-tested an objective lens with a high numerical aperture (0.36) and a long working distance (35 mm) consisting of standard catalogue lenses. Using 780 nm light, suitable for imaging rubidium condensates, this objective can achieve a resolution of 1.3 μm across a diffraction-limited field of view of 360 μm through a 5 mm thick glass window of a science cell. By changing the spacing between the lens elements, this objective lens can compensate for the aberrations produced by a glass window up to 15 mm thick, and by changing the aperture size the objective becomes suitable for diffraction-limited monochromatic imaging on the D2 line of all the alkalis. Before performing proof-of-principle magnetic resonance control experiments on real Bose–Einstein condensates, we needed to construct an experimental apparatus capable of producing spinor Bose–Einstein condensates. In this thesis I summarise my main contributions to this group endeavour, including: constructing the ultra-high vacuum system; supervising the bakeout of our vacuum system; designing and aligning the optical systems to produce laser beams of different, tunable frequencies to trap, cool, and image rubidium gas; trapping a cloud of rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap; constructing laser beam shutters, photodetectors, and photodetector signal filters; and designing and constructing our side imaging and top imaging systems. Using our spinor Bose–Einstein condensate apparatus, I performed the first proof-of-principle magnetic resonance control experiments. With a pair of condensates side-by-side, separated by 200 μm, we can use magnetic resonance control to invert the spin of one condensate only, while leaving the other condensate unaffected. We anticipate magnetic resonance control being used in the laboratory to engineer the first black soliton in a Bose–Einstein condensate. Looking beyond solitons, magnetic resonance control could have applications to the field of magnon spintronics, and extending the technique to higher dimensions could enable the study of exotic topological defects such as spin knots in a quantum fluid.},

In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr\{{\textbackslash}"o\}dinger picture.

	abstract = {We review the advancement of the research toward the design and implementation of quantum plenoptic cameras, radically novel 3D imaging devices that exploit both momentum-position entanglement and photon-number correlations to provide the typical refocusing and ultra-fast, scanning-free, 3D imaging capability of plenoptic devices, along with dramatically enhanced performances, unattainable in standard plenoptic cameras: diffraction-limited resolution, large depth of focus, and ultra-low noise. To further increase the volumetric resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit, and achieve the quantum limit, we are also developing dedicated protocols based on quantum Fisher information. However, for the quantum advantages of the proposed devices to be effective and appealing to end-users, two main challenges need to be tackled. First, due to the large number of frames required for correlation measurements to provide an acceptable SNR, quantum plenoptic imaging would require, if implemented with commercially available high-resolution cameras, acquisition times ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes. Second, the elaboration of this large amount of data, in order to retrieve 3D images or refocusing 2D images, requires high-performance and time-consuming computation. To address these challenges, we are developing high-resolution SPAD arrays and high-performance low-level programming of ultra-fast electronics, combined with compressive sensing and quantum tomography algorithms, with the aim to reduce both the acquisition and the elaboration time by two orders of magnitude. Routes toward exploitation of the QPI devices will also be discussed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07741},
	abstract = {Quantum states of light can enable sensing configurations with sensitivities beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL). In order to better take advantage of available quantum resources and obtain the maximum possible sensitivity, it is necessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different possible configurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide applicability, we focus on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in a parameter of interest through a resonance shift. We compare their fundamental sensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound (QCRB) based on the estimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode squeezed state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity results from an interplay between the QCRB and the transfer function of the system. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian lineshape a phase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the parameter space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper slopes, such as higher order Butterworth lineshapes. Furthermore, such an interplay results in conditions under which the phase-based scheme provides a higher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of quantum enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor on the degree of quantum enhancement and show that for certain conditions probing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity than probing with a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized intensity-difference and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the fundamental sensitivity limits even in the presence of external losses.},

	abstract = {Quantum control techniques applied at macroscopic scales provide us with opportunities in fundamental physics and practical applications. Among them, measurement-based feedback allows efficient control of optomechanical systems and quantum-enhanced sensing. In this paper, we propose a near-resonant narrow-band force sensor with extremely low optically added noise in an optomechanical system subject to a feedback-controlled in-loop light. The membrane's intrinsic motion consisting of zero-point motion and thermal motion is affected by the added noise of measurement due to the backaction noise and imprecision noise. We show that, in the optimal low-noise regime, the system is analogous to an optomechanical system containing a near quantum-limited optical parametric amplifier coupled to an engineered reservoir interacting with the cavity. Therefore, the feedback loop enhances the mechanical response of the system to the input while keeping the optically added noise of measurement below the standard quantum limit. Moreover, the system based on feedback offers a much larger amplification bandwidth than the same system with no feedback.},

The quantum transitions employed in present day atomic beam standards occur between the hyperfine levels in the ground state of the alkali metal cesium. The hyperfine splitting arises because of the interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus and the magnetic field produced by the valence electron at the position of the nucleus. The vector model is a simple and useful concept for the analysis of the fine and hyperfine structure of atoms in either very weak or very strong externally applied fields. The atomic trajectories and deflections can be calculated rather simply for the elementary field configurations ordinarily used in the deflecting fields of atomic beam machines. The beam intensity and intensity distribution are elaborated. The transition probability for two separated oscillating fields is also described.},

	abstract = {Recently, nanomaterials are arousing increasing interest and a wide variety of opto-electronic devices have been developed, such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors. However, the study of the light emission properties of quantum dots under pressure is still limited. By using a joint theoretical and experimental approach, we developed a polymer waveguide doped with CdSe quantum dots for pressure sensing. Absorption and re-emission effects of the quantum dots are affected by the pressure applied on the waveguide. Specifically, since both amplitude and wavelength are modulated, not only the pressure can be detected, but also its location along the waveguide. The calibration results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed force sensor design. Theoretical model and simulations further validate the presented sensing principle. The proposed prototype benefits from the main advantages of optical sensors, such as their predisposition to miniaturization, small cable sizes and weights, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and safe operation in hazard environments. In addition, bio-compatibility, non-toxicity and flexibility make the presented sensor potentially appealing to various application fields such as nanobiotechnology and robotic sensing.},

We provide optimized decompositions up to order t6. The leading error term is expanded in nested commutators (Hall bases) and we minimize the 1-norm of the coefficients. For n=2 terms, several of the optima we find are close to those in McLachlan (1995). Generally, our results substantially improve over unoptimized decompositions by Forest, Ruth, Yoshida, and Suzuki.
