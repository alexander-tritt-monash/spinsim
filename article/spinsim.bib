	abstract = {Magnetic fields from neuronal action potentials (APs) pass largely unperturbed through biological tissue, allowing magnetic measurements of AP dynamics to be performed extracellularly or even outside intact organisms. To date, however, magnetic techniques for sensing neuronal activity have either operated at the macroscale with coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution—e.g., magnetic resonance imaging methods and magnetoencephalography—or been restricted to biophysics studies of excised neurons probed with cryogenic or bulky detectors that do not provide single-neuron spatial resolution and are not scalable to functional networks or intact organisms. Here, we show that AP magnetic sensing can be realized with both single-neuron sensitivity and intact organism applicability using optically probed nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in diamond, operated under ambient conditions and with the NV diamond sensor in close proximity (∼10 µm) to the biological sample. We demonstrate this method for excised single neurons from marine worm and squid, and then exterior to intact, optically opaque marine worms for extended periods and with no observed adverse effect on the animal. NV diamond magnetometry is noninvasive and label-free and does not cause photodamage. The method provides precise measurement of AP waveforms from individual neurons, as well as magnetic field correlates of the AP conduction velocity, and directly determines the AP propagation direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic field vector.},

	abstract = {The rotation of a quantum bit (qubit) is an important step in quantum computation. The rotation is generally performed using a Rabi oscillation. In a direct two-level qubit system, if the Rabi frequency is comparable to its resonance frequency, the rotating wave approximation is not valid, and the Rabi oscillation is accompanied by the so-called Bloch–Siegert oscillation (BSO) that occurs at twice the frequency of the driving field. One implication of the BSO is that for a given interaction time and Rabi frequency, the degree of rotation experienced by the qubit depends explicitly on the initial phase of the driving field. If this effect is not controlled, it leads to an apparent fluctuation in the rotation of the qubit. Here we show that when an off-resonant lambda system is used to realize a two-level qubit, the BSO is inherently negligible, thus eliminating this source of potential error.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing and many research activities associated with it can be seen as a framework for signal processing of low-complexity structures. A cornerstone of the underlying theory is the study of inverse problems with linear or nonlinear measurements. Whether it is sparsity, low-rankness, or other familiar notions of low complexity, the theory addresses necessary and sufficient conditions behind the measurement process to guarantee signal reconstruction with efficient algorithms. This includes consideration of robustness to measurement noise and stability with respect to signal model inaccuracies. This introduction aims to provide an overall view of some of the most important results in this direction. After discussing various examples of low-complexity signal models, two approaches to linear inverse problems are introduced which, respectively, focus on the recovery of individual signals and recovery of all low-complexity signals simultaneously. In particular, we focus on the former setting, giving rise to so-called nonuniform signal recovery problems. We discuss different necessary and sufficient conditions for stable and robust signal reconstruction using convex optimization methods. Appealing to concepts from non-asymptotic random matrix theory, we outline how certain classes of random sensing matrices, which fully govern the measurement process, satisfy certain sufficient conditions for signal recovery. Finally, we review some of the most prominent algorithms for signal recovery proposed in the literature.},

With a segmented model of mammalian pyramidal neurons, we show that the APMF of intra-axonal currents in the axon hillock are two orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal locations. Expected 2D magnetic field maps of naturalistic spiking activity of a volume of neurons via widefield diamond-nitrogen-vacancy-center-magnetometry were simulated.

It has been difficult, however, to determine precisely what this proposal amounts to. Almost without exception, commentators have held that there are ambiguities in Everett's theory of measurement that result from significant—even embarrassing—omissions. In the present paper, we resist the conclusion that Everett's proposal is incomplete, and we develop a close reading that accounts for apparent oversights. We begin by taking a look at how Everett set up his project—his method and his criterion of success. Illuminating parallels are found between Everett's method and then-contemporary thought regarding inter-theoretic reduction. Also, from unpublished papers and correspondence, we are able to piece together how Everett judged the success of his theory of measurement, which completes our account of his intended contribution to the resolution of the quantum measurement problem.},

	abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the application of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to reaction kineties, sodium resonance and hydrogen-bonding. In Section 1 a historical introduction to N. M. R. is given. Section 2 deals with the theory of N. M. R. , and the classical approach to it, and concludes with the derivation of the Bloch equations. Section 3 discusses the quantum mechanical approach to the theory of N. M. R. The close proximity of the results of the classical and quantum mechanical approaches is shown. Section 4 deals with the introduction of nuclear density matrices to the theory of N. M. R. Section 5 is mainly concerned with the application of the Bloch equations to reaction kinetics. Chemical shift and multiplet type signal collapses are discussed fully. The last part of this section deals with nuclear magnetization transfer. Section 6 discusses the application of the nuclear density matrix to reaction kinetics. Section 7a contains studies on the hydration of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and diacetyl. The equilibrium constants of the hydration were obtained. The hydrogen ion catalysis of the hydration of acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde was observed, and a rate law obtained for the former case. An explanation of the observed anomalous behaviour of the acetaldehyde hydration is given. Section 7b contains the study of the hydration of pyruvic acid. The equilibrium constant and the rate law of the hydrogen ion catalysis are discussed. Section 8 contains a study made on sodium Na23 magnetic resonance. The dependance of the intensity and half-width on the concentration of sodium hydroxide and chloride is given in detail. Section 9 contains a study of the hydrogen-bonding of some substituted phenols. The results indicate that in an inert solvent, phenols form mainly cyclic trimers. The equilibrium constants were obtained.},

	abstract = {Exact numerical simulations of NMR experiments are often required for the development of new techniques and for the extraction of structural and dynamic information from the spectra. Simulations of solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments can be particularly demanding both computationally and in terms of the programming required to carry them out, even if special simulation software is used. We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these computations. In the present paper, we describe SPINEVOLUTION, a highly optimized computer program that implements the new methodology. The algorithms used in the program will be described separately. Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and multi-spin systems in solids, SPINEVOLUTION is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and optimization of virtually any NMR experiment. The performance of SPINEVOLUTION was compared with that of another recently developed NMR simulation package, SIMPSON. Benchmarked on a series of examples, SPINEVOLUTION was consistently found to be orders of magnitude faster. At the time of publication, the program is available gratis for non-commercial use.},

	abstract = {The theoretical transition energies of a spin 3/2 under a combination of quadrupolar and Zeeman interactions are mapped out as a function of magnetic field. This allows us to follow the spectroscopy continuously from zero magnetic field (NQR, nuclear quadrupole resonance) through to high magnetic field (quadrupole-perturbed NMR). This calculation is made possible by a theoretical approach that makes maximum use of the angular momentum properties of the spin system. In this approach, the detailed form of the spin operators are not required, only their angular momentum quantum numbers. No commutators need be evaluated, and the method is easily coded for computer calculation. Application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules means that there are only two nonzero reduced matrix elements that are needed for a spin 3/2, and there are explicit formulae for them. In looking at the transition energies, the crucial parameter is the orientation of the quadrupole tensor to the magnetic field. If the angle is nonzero, then the quantization of the spins must shift. At zero field, the quantization is defined by the electric field gradient tensor, which is molecule-fixed at some arbitrary angle to the magnetic field. This direction of quantization must change as the magnetic field increases, to lie close to the z axis at high field. In the region where the two interactions are comparable, all the familiar rules break down and the response is highly nonlinear. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast 3D MRI simulator for arbitrary k-space sampling using a graphical processing unit (GPU) and demonstrate its performance by comparing simulation and experimental results in a real MRI system.Materials and Methods: A fast 3D MRI simulator using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was developed using C++ and the CUDA 8.0 platform (NVIDIA Corporation). The unique advantage of this simulator was that it could use the same pulse sequence as used in the experiment. The performance of the MRI simulator was measured using two GTX 1080 GPUs and 3D Cones sequences. The MRI simulation results for 3D non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like 3D Cones sequences using a numerical 3D phantom were compared with the experimental results obtained with a real MRI system and a real 3D phantom.Results: The performance of the MRI simulator was about 3800–4900 gigaflops for 128- to 4-shot 3D Cones sequences with 2563 voxels, which was about 60\% of the performance of the previous MRI simulator optimized for Cartesian sampling calculated for a Cartesian sampling gradient-echo sequence with 2563 voxels. The effects of the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, radio-frequency field inhomogeneity, gradient field nonlinearity, and fast repetition times on the MR images were reproduced in the simulated images as observed in the experimental images.Conclusion: The 3D MRI simulator developed for arbitrary k-space sampling optimized using GPUs is a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of advanced imaging sequences including both Cartesian and non-Cartesian k-space sampling.},

Experiments and simulations were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the MRI simulator for three types of pulse sequences, namely, three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo, 3D radio-frequency spoiled gradient-echo, and gradient-echo multislice with practical matrix sizes. The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful MRI simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for MRI research and development.},

Much of the motivation for exploring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in the past decade has been for their potential as a solid-state alternative to trapped ions for quantum computing. In this area, the NV center has exceeded expectations and even shown an unprecedented capability to perform certain quantum processing and storage operations at room temperature. The ability to operate in ambient conditions, combined with the atom-like magnetic Zeeman sensitivity, has also led to intensive investigation of NV centers as nanoscale magnetometers. Thus, aside from room-temperature solid-state quantum computers, the NV could also be used to image individual spins in biological systems, eventually leading to a new level of understanding of biomolecular interactions in living cells.},

	title = {Spinor {Bose}-{Einstein} condensates in magnetic field gradients},
	url = {/articles/thesis/Spinor_Bose-Einstein_condensates_in_magnetic_field_gradients/4697395/1},
	abstract = {Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are multi-component superfluids with magnetic interactions, formed from dilute gases of atoms in the Zeeman sublevels mF of a single hyperfine ground state F. Spinor BECs are inherently magnetic quantum objects, and exhibit a multitude of features such as spin domains, magnon excitations, and distinct magnetic phases. At the heart of the magnetic nature of a spinor BEC is the spin-dependent collisional interaction c, which determines the overall magnetic behaviour of the superfluid. In conjunction with the quadratic Zeeman shift q, the magnitude and sign of c give rise to an intricate magnetic phase diagram. The magnetic phase of a spinor BEC is tunable, and c and q are the knobs. In addition to realising quantum simulators of magnetism, spinor BECs are also precise magnetic sensors. Atomic magnetometry measures the Larmor precession frequency of atoms, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength. The sensitivity of an atomic magnetometer is principally dependent on the duration of the measurement (interrogation time) and number of atoms participating in the measurement. BECs are highly suitable as atomic magnetometers, allowing for long interrogation times and high atomic density, with microscopic sensor volumes. The latter is an important consideration, as measurement of small magnetic sources demand equally microscopic sensors. Established forms of magnetometry (such as warm vapour magnetometers) use large sensing volumes and are not trivially miniaturised. The exquisite sensitivity of a spinor BEC to magnetic fields becomes a liability when one studies low energy ({\textasciitilde} 1 Hz) spinor physics over long evolution times (100 ms) in a typical laboratory environment. To first order, the spin-collisional interaction is independent of the magnetic field. However, spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields are problematic, exerting mechanical forces on the magnetically sensitive spin components, suppressing spin collisions and possibly introducing relaxation mechanisms that confound the observation of intrinsic equilibration. Precise characterisation of magnetic field gradients and their cancellation is thus of paramount importance. In this thesis, the interaction of a spinor BEC with its environment is studied. The construction, operation and optimisation of a BEC machine is described in detail, as well as the quantum state preparation and control techniques used. Spin-mixing collisions were studied by observing population oscillations, the characteristic hallmark of such coherent phenomena. The observed population dynamics showed strong evidence of the deleterious effects of magnetic field gradients. A series of experiments were performed using spin-echo pulse sequences to decouple the evolving spinor condensate from the inhomogeneous magnetic environment with encouraging results, but which posed further questions. The fidelity of spin-echo pulses in the strong radiative coupling regime was also studied. Spinor condensates were then employed as sensitive magnetometers to characterise the magnetic landscape they inhabit. A new method of measuring magnetic field gradients was developed, using a pair of spinor BECs separated in space that are simultaneously addressed by a Ramsey interferometry sequence. Combined with a re-orientable magnetic bias field, the resulting gradiometer was used to measure the magnetic field gradient tensor in vacuo. This scheme can be extended to realise a high-precision vector co-magnetometer, with spatiotemporal sensitivity comparable to established forms of magnetometry. Vector light shifts (VLSs) are optically-induced energy shifts that result in effective magnetic fields, which in our case originate from the laser beams used to trap the atoms. The VLS vanishes for purely linearly polarised light, which is experimentally difficult to obtain in vacuo. Small elliptical polarisation imperfections originating from birefringent optics and the glass vacuum cell result in a non-zero shift that contaminates magnetometry measurements. The VLS is spatially varying due to the intensity gradient of the trapping light. Due to gravitational sag of the trapping potential, the spatial variation of the VLS is accentuated, resulting in an effective magnetic field gradient that contributes to dephasing and component separation. The simultaneous Ramsey interferometry experiments are then adapted to measure the VLS-induced Zeeman shift and diagnose its elimination. Up to 99.96\% of the VLS is eliminated using this method, and extensions to the technique are described.},

The quantum properties of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) defect in diamond can be used as an atomic compass needle that is sensitive to tiny variations in magnetic field. Schmitt et al. and Boss et al. successfully enhanced this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude (see the Perspective by Jordan). They applied a sequence of pulses to the NV center, the timing of which was set by and compared with a highly stable oscillator. This allowed them to measure the frequency of an oscillating magnetic field (megahertz bandwidth) with submillihertz resolution. Such enhanced precision measurement could be applied, for example, to improve nuclear magnetic resonance-based imaging protocols of single molecules.
Science, this issue p. 832, p. 837; see also p. 802
Quantum sensing takes advantage of well-controlled quantum systems for performing measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have implemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution, independent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external synchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to continuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 104 for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.

	abstract = {This thesis presents a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with the paramagnetic Faraday effect. This quantum-photon interface couples the spin of the BEC to the polarisation of an off-resonant laser, which in a magnetic field gradient allows a 1D density profile of the BEC to be reconstructed. As opposed to conventional imaging techniques that are destructive or diffraction limited, this technique is minimally destructive to the BEC and not diffraction limited. Multishot in situ imaging of a single condensate is therefore possible, paving the way for time-resolved studies and 2D/3D reconstructions. A theoretical model for Faraday imaging is developed using the tensor polarisability formalism for the atom-light interaction, and the signal-to-noise ratio is derived. Resolution limits induced by Stern-Gerlach separation are considered, encouraging rapid measurements with strong magnetic field gradients. Analysing the trapping potential reveals that the `magic-zero' wavelength 790nm produces no dipole force and enables a tightly focused probe laser to be used without perturbing the trap. Polarisation-maintaining fibers were seen to impart large fluctuations depending on the incident polarisation, which were minimised. The broad diode laser emission background is seen to reduce the lifetime of the BEC, which was corrected with an interference filter. Short-time Fourier transforms are used to process the photodetected signal, showing the evolution of the polarisation rotation frequency and amplitude. Frequency-modulation is observed at the power line frequency, corresponding to magnetic field fluctuations induced by nearby equipment. Birefringence of optical elements results in elliptical polarisation of the probe and an effective magnetic field, which is cancelled using a quarter-waveplate. The quadratic Zeeman effect causes rapid amplitude modulation, and is eliminated by applying a microwave dressing field. Radiative spin echo is achieved in a magnetic field gradient, proving that dephasing is coherent, and that multishot imaging possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed on a partially-evaporated atom cloud, distinguishing the thermal and condensed fractions. A split dipole trap is used to create two spatially separated BECs, which are individually resolved during MRI. The resolution is only limited by the strength of the applied magnetic field gradient, and is not subject to the diffraction limit. Custom coils will enable MRI of condensates at the sub-micron scale.},

	abstract = {To detect a stealth target, one may directly probe it with a single photon and analyze the reflected signals. The efficiency of such conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the classical limits. The question is what is the optimal signal state for achieving the detection limit? Here, we address this question in a general discrete model, and derive a complete set of analytic solutions. For one-shot detection, the parameter space can be classified into three distinct regions, in the form of a “phase diagram” for both conventional and quantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is less than some critical value, all received signals become useless, which is true even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a region where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional illumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an entanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the environmental noise state and is, surprisingly, independent of the occurrence probability and the reflectivity of the object. The entanglement of the ideal probe state increases with the entropy of the environment; it becomes more entangled as the temperature of the environment increases. Finally, we show that the performance advantage cannot be fully characterized by any measure of quantum correlation, unless the environment is a complete mixed state.},

The method scales the matrix by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1, computes a Padé approximant to the matrix exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give a new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Padé approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Padé approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37\% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Padé approximation to the function x coth(x).

	abstract = {This paper deals with the stability of some one-step methods for computing the action of a matrix exponential on a vector, i.e. eAb, where A is an n-by-n matrix and b is a vector of dimension n. The methods are based on certain assumptions made for the case that A is a matrix having sufficiently small norm. If the norm of A is larger, a fixed step size is used to perform a scaling of A. An analysis of the roundoff error of the computed eAb shows that these methods are backward stable if A is Hermitian, and forward stable if, for example, A is skew-Hermitian or if A is real and essentially nonnegative and b is real and nonnegative. In addition, an upper bound on the forward error of the computed eAb is obtained for all A and b. This bound, which is expressed in terms of the condition number, is evaluated for several examples of the data. The results of this paper partly apply to the algorithm proposed by Al-Mohy and Higham (2011) for computing eAb.},

	abstract = {In the present paper we consider numerical methods to solve the discrete Schrödinger equation with a time dependent Hamiltonian (motivated by problems encountered in the study of spin systems). We will consider both short-range interactions, which lead to evolution equations involving sparse matrices, and long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings show very different computational characteristics. We use Magnus integrators for time integration and employ a framework based on Leja interpolation to compute the resulting action of the matrix exponential. We consider both traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of problems in the literature) as well as the recently developed commutator-free Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) based systems. We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of 10 in the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of more efficient numerical methods.},

However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be signiﬁcantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Approximate resolution of linear systems of differential equations with varying coefficients is a recurrent problem, shared by a number of scientific and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an elegant setting to build up approximate exponential representations of the solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the important additional property of preserving, at any order, certain symmetries of the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series, generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third, to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus expansion, in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard numerical integrators. We buttress this issue with a revision of the wide range of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature.},

The effort of quantum tomography--the reconstruction of states and processes of a quantum device--scales unfavourably: state-of-the-art systems can no longer be characterized. Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by reconstructing states from incomplete data. Here we present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven-qubit system--a topological colour code prepared in a trapped ion architecture. We are in the highly incomplete--127 Pauli basis measurement settings--and highly noisy--100 repetitions each--regime. Originally, compressed sensing was advocated for states with few non-zero eigenvalues. We argue that low-rank estimates are appropriate in general since statistical noise enables reliable reconstruction of only the leading eigenvectors. The remaining eigenvectors behave consistently with a random-matrix model that carries no information about the true state.},

Compressed sensing, a machinery derived from the theory of signal processing, has emerged as a feasible tool to perform robust and significantly more resource-economical quantum state tomography for intermediate-sized quantum systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of compressed sensing tomography in the regime in which tomographically complete data is available with reliable statistics from experimental observations of a multi-mode photonic architecture. Due to the fact that the data is known with high statistical significance, we are in a position to systematically explore the quality of reconstruction depending on the number of employed measurement settings, randomly selected from the complete set of data, and on different model assumptions. We present and test a complete prescription to perform efficient compressed sensing and are able to reliably use notions of model selection and cross validation to account for experimental imperfections and finite counting statistics. Thus, we establish compressed sensing as an effective tool for quantum state tomography, specifically suited for photonic systems.},

We show that incoherent measurement bases and, more generally, suitable random measurement matrices can be created by performing simple control sequences on the quantum system. Random measurement matrices satisfying the restricted isometry property can be used efficiently to reconstruct signals that are sparse in any basis.

	abstract = {We describe LLVM (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

	abstract = {A radiofrequency-dressed (RF) spin-1/2 system provides a model to predict and understand the
behaviour of RF-dressed spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). RF-dressed spinor BECs are
theorised to be highly sensitive quantum sensors, with the potential to measure weak oscillating
magnetic fields such as those produced by neuron impulses. Through this project, we aimed to
investigate whether taking the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was a sufficiently thorough
treatment for laboratory frame BEC systems and if not, to determine whether error contributions
were sufficient to impact detection of weak signals. Through simulation of the RF-dressed spin-1/2
system in the laboratory frame at three different Rabi frequencies of Ω = 10 kHz, Ω = 5 kHz and
Ω = 1 kHz, application of mathematical equivalents to the experimental process of demodulation
were performed on the simulated system measurements, with both in-phase and in-quadrature errors
appearing. Further analysis led to induced detunings of ∆10 = 34.902(5) Hz, ∆5 = 8.7222(8) Hz and
∆1 = 0.348988(5) Hz that were shown to directly correlate with the first-order Bloch-Siegert shift,
a beyond-RWA effect. Application of a weak signal to the system then indicated that this detuning
introduced was sufficiently weak that signal detection was unaffected for resonant signals as weak
as Ω2 = 10 Hz, with indications weaker signals would still remain unaffected. These results indicate
beyond-RWA effects are non-negligible but insufficient to affect detection of resonant weak signals,
indicating future applications to neuron impulse detection may remain unaffected by beyond-RWA
effects.},

	title = {Precise engineering of the {Bose}-{Einstein} condensate wavefunction using magnetic resonance control},
	url = {/articles/thesis/Precise_engineering_of_the_Bose-Einstein_condensate_wavefunction_using_magnetic_resonance_control/4719724/1},
	abstract = {To engineer the wavefunction of a Bose–Einstein condensate is to exert control over both the density and phase of the Bose–Einstein condensate order parameter. Having the ability to engineer the condensate order parameter down to the smallest length scale relevant to condensate dynamics—the healing length scale—would enable the study of new combinations of topological defects and may pave the way to using Bose–Einstein condensates as versatile, precise quantum simulators. In this thesis, we present a new wavefunction engineering technique which reaches the sub-optical healing length scale. Influenced by magnetic resonance imaging, we name this technique magnetic resonance control. This technique uses time-varying coupling between internal spin states of a spinor Bose–Einstein condensate within a magnetic field gradient to address spatial regions of the condensate, enabling control over both the phase and the density of the condensate order parameter down to the healing length scale. Techniques already exist to engineer condensate wavefunctions, but not with such a fine degree of control. These techniques primarily rely on either the intensity variation of a laser beam, which limits the resolution to the diffraction limit (larger than the typically sub-optical healing length scale), or the adiabatic inversion of a magnetic trapping potential, which can not be easily changed to produce a variety of structures in the condensate wavefunction. To develop our magnetic resonance control technique, we simulate a spinor condensate in one dimension with time-dependent coupling between spin states and time-dependent external magnetic field gradients using the Gross–Pitaevskii equation. We show that magnetic resonance control can engineer a single black soliton using experimentally feasible parameters. A black soliton is an ideal target state to select for this demonstration because engineering such a state requires control over both the phase and density of the condensate with healing-length resolution. We demonstrate that magnetic resonance control can be extended to engineer more complicated target states by simulating the creation of multiple solitons in a condensate, with control over the initial positions and trajectories of the solitons. When magnetic resonance control is applied to Bose–Einstein condensates in the laboratory, it will be necessary to have an imaging system capable of resolving the fine structures created. As an alternative to high-cost, custom-manufactured lenses, and in-vacuum optical systems, I have designed and bench-tested an objective lens with a high numerical aperture (0.36) and a long working distance (35 mm) consisting of standard catalogue lenses. Using 780 nm light, suitable for imaging rubidium condensates, this objective can achieve a resolution of 1.3 μm across a diffraction-limited field of view of 360 μm through a 5 mm thick glass window of a science cell. By changing the spacing between the lens elements, this objective lens can compensate for the aberrations produced by a glass window up to 15 mm thick, and by changing the aperture size the objective becomes suitable for diffraction-limited monochromatic imaging on the D2 line of all the alkalis. Before performing proof-of-principle magnetic resonance control experiments on real Bose–Einstein condensates, we needed to construct an experimental apparatus capable of producing spinor Bose–Einstein condensates. In this thesis I summarise my main contributions to this group endeavour, including: constructing the ultra-high vacuum system; supervising the bakeout of our vacuum system; designing and aligning the optical systems to produce laser beams of different, tunable frequencies to trap, cool, and image rubidium gas; trapping a cloud of rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap; constructing laser beam shutters, photodetectors, and photodetector signal filters; and designing and constructing our side imaging and top imaging systems. Using our spinor Bose–Einstein condensate apparatus, I performed the first proof-of-principle magnetic resonance control experiments. With a pair of condensates side-by-side, separated by 200 μm, we can use magnetic resonance control to invert the spin of one condensate only, while leaving the other condensate unaffected. We anticipate magnetic resonance control being used in the laboratory to engineer the first black soliton in a Bose–Einstein condensate. Looking beyond solitons, magnetic resonance control could have applications to the field of magnon spintronics, and extending the technique to higher dimensions could enable the study of exotic topological defects such as spin knots in a quantum fluid.},

In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr\{{\textbackslash}"o\}dinger picture.

	abstract = {We review the advancement of the research toward the design and implementation of quantum plenoptic cameras, radically novel 3D imaging devices that exploit both momentum-position entanglement and photon-number correlations to provide the typical refocusing and ultra-fast, scanning-free, 3D imaging capability of plenoptic devices, along with dramatically enhanced performances, unattainable in standard plenoptic cameras: diffraction-limited resolution, large depth of focus, and ultra-low noise. To further increase the volumetric resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit, and achieve the quantum limit, we are also developing dedicated protocols based on quantum Fisher information. However, for the quantum advantages of the proposed devices to be effective and appealing to end-users, two main challenges need to be tackled. First, due to the large number of frames required for correlation measurements to provide an acceptable SNR, quantum plenoptic imaging would require, if implemented with commercially available high-resolution cameras, acquisition times ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes. Second, the elaboration of this large amount of data, in order to retrieve 3D images or refocusing 2D images, requires high-performance and time-consuming computation. To address these challenges, we are developing high-resolution SPAD arrays and high-performance low-level programming of ultra-fast electronics, combined with compressive sensing and quantum tomography algorithms, with the aim to reduce both the acquisition and the elaboration time by two orders of magnitude. Routes toward exploitation of the QPI devices will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {Quantum states of light can enable sensing configurations with sensitivities beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL). In order to better take advantage of available quantum resources and obtain the maximum possible sensitivity, it is necessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different possible configurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide applicability, we focus on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in a parameter of interest through a resonance shift. We compare their fundamental sensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound (QCRB) based on the estimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode squeezed state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity results from an interplay between the QCRB and the transfer function of the system. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian lineshape a phase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the parameter space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper slopes, such as higher order Butterworth lineshapes. Furthermore, such an interplay results in conditions under which the phase-based scheme provides a higher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of quantum enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor on the degree of quantum enhancement and show that for certain conditions probing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity than probing with a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized intensity-difference and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the fundamental sensitivity limits even in the presence of external losses.},

	abstract = {Quantum control techniques applied at macroscopic scales provide us with opportunities in fundamental physics and practical applications. Among them, measurement-based feedback allows efficient control of optomechanical systems and quantum-enhanced sensing. In this paper, we propose a near-resonant narrow-band force sensor with extremely low optically added noise in an optomechanical system subject to a feedback-controlled in-loop light. The membrane's intrinsic motion consisting of zero-point motion and thermal motion is affected by the added noise of measurement due to the backaction noise and imprecision noise. We show that, in the optimal low-noise regime, the system is analogous to an optomechanical system containing a near quantum-limited optical parametric amplifier coupled to an engineered reservoir interacting with the cavity. Therefore, the feedback loop enhances the mechanical response of the system to the input while keeping the optically added noise of measurement below the standard quantum limit. Moreover, the system based on feedback offers a much larger amplification bandwidth than the same system with no feedback.},

The quantum transitions employed in present day atomic beam standards occur between the hyperfine levels in the ground state of the alkali metal cesium. The hyperfine splitting arises because of the interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus and the magnetic field produced by the valence electron at the position of the nucleus. The vector model is a simple and useful concept for the analysis of the fine and hyperfine structure of atoms in either very weak or very strong externally applied fields. The atomic trajectories and deflections can be calculated rather simply for the elementary field configurations ordinarily used in the deflecting fields of atomic beam machines. The beam intensity and intensity distribution are elaborated. The transition probability for two separated oscillating fields is also described.},

	abstract = {Recently, nanomaterials are arousing increasing interest and a wide variety of opto-electronic devices have been developed, such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors. However, the study of the light emission properties of quantum dots under pressure is still limited. By using a joint theoretical and experimental approach, we developed a polymer waveguide doped with CdSe quantum dots for pressure sensing. Absorption and re-emission effects of the quantum dots are affected by the pressure applied on the waveguide. Specifically, since both amplitude and wavelength are modulated, not only the pressure can be detected, but also its location along the waveguide. The calibration results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed force sensor design. Theoretical model and simulations further validate the presented sensing principle. The proposed prototype benefits from the main advantages of optical sensors, such as their predisposition to miniaturization, small cable sizes and weights, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and safe operation in hazard environments. In addition, bio-compatibility, non-toxicity and flexibility make the presented sensor potentially appealing to various application fields such as nanobiotechnology and robotic sensing.},

We provide optimized decompositions up to order t6. The leading error term is expanded in nested commutators (Hall bases) and we minimize the 1-norm of the coefficients. For n=2 terms, several of the optima we find are close to those in McLachlan (1995). Generally, our results substantially improve over unoptimized decompositions by Forest, Ruth, Yoshida, and Suzuki. We explain why these decompositions are sufficient to efficiently simulate any one- or two-dimensional lattice model with finite-range interactions.

	abstract = {This paper considers the optimal control problem for realizing logical gates in a closed quantum system. The quantum state is governed by Schrodinger's equation, which we formulate as a time-dependent Hamiltonian system in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the state vector. The system is discretized with the Stormer-Verlet scheme, which is a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method. Our main theoretical contribution is the derivation of a compatible time-discretization of the adjoint state equation, such that the gradient of the discrete objective function can be calculated exactly, at a computational cost of solving two Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger systems, independently of the number of parameters in the control functions. A parameterization of the control functions based on B-splines with built-in carrier waves is also introduced. The carrier waves are used to specify the frequency spectra of the control functions, while the B-spline functions specify their envelope and phase. This approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and significantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating Schrodinger's equation. We consider Hamiltonians that model the dynamics of a superconducting multi-level qudit and present numerical examples of how the proposed technique can be combined with the interior point L-BFGS algorithm from the IPOPT package for realizing quantum gates. In a set of test cases, the proposed algorithm is shown to compare favorably with QuTiP/pulse\_optim and Grape-Tensorflow.},

We show how to harness the spatial correlations to sense only a specific signal, and be insensitive to others at different positions or with unequal spatial dependence by constructing a decoherence-free subspace for noise sources at fixed, known positions. This can be extended to noise sources lying on certain surfaces, where we encounter a connection to mirror charges and equipotential surfaces in classical electrostatics. For general situations, we introduce the notion of an approximate decoherence-free subspace, where noise for all sources within some volume is significantly suppressed, at the cost of reducing the signal strength in a controlled way. We show that one can use this approach to maintain Heisenberg-scaling over long times and for a large number of sensors, despite the presence of multiple noise sources in large volumes. We introduce an efficient formalism to construct internal states and sensor configurations, and apply it to several examples to demonstrate the usefulness and wide applicability of our approach.},

For supremacy circuits the speedup is around 2x, and for quantum multipliers almost 22x compared to state-of-the-art C++-based simulators.},

	abstract = {Magnetic field source localization and imaging happen at different scales. The sensing baseline ranges from meter scale such as magnetic anomaly detection, centimeter scale such as brain field imaging to nanometer scale such as the imaging of magnetic skyrmion and single cell. Here we show how atomic vapor cell can be used to realize a baseline of 109.6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m with a magnetic sensitivity of 10pT/sqrt(Hz)@0.6-100Hz and a dynamic range of 2062-4124nT.We use free induction decay (FID) scheme to suppress low-frequency noise and avoid scale factor variation for different domains due to light non-uniformity. The measurement domains are scanned by digital micro-mirror device (DMD). The currents of 22mA, 30mA, 38mA and 44mA are applied in the coils to generate different fields along the pumping axis which are measured respectively by fitting the FID signals of the probe light. The residual fields of every domain are obtained from the intercept of linearly-fitting of the measurement data corresponding to these four currents. The coil-generated fields are calculated by deducting the residual fields from the total fields. The results demonstrate that the hole of shield affects both the residual and the coil-generated field distribution. The potential impact of field distribution measurement with an outstanding comprehensive properties of spatial resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range is far-reaching. It could lead to capability of 3D magnetography for small stuffs and/or organs in millimeter or even smaller scale.},

On the other side, the gravity perturbation will affect the sensitivity of the system to deposition mass. In order to further enhance the sensitivity of the system to quantum gravity, we extend the system to the other one which has a higher-order (third-order) exceptional point.

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language.

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The use of the nuclear spins surrounding electron spin qubits as quantum registers and long-lived memories opens the way to new applications in quantum information and biological sensing. Hence, there is a need for generic and robust forms of control of the nuclear registers. Although adiabatic gates are widely used in quantum information, they can become too slow to outpace decoherence. Here, we introduce a technique whereby adiabatic gates arise from the dynamical decoupling protocols that simultaneously extend coherence. We illustrate this pulse-based adiabatic control for nuclear spins around NV centers in diamond. We obtain a closed-form expression from Landau-Zener theory and show that it reliably describes the dynamics. By identifying robust Floquet states, we show that the technique enables polarisation, one-shot flips and state storage for nuclear spins. These results introduce a new control paradigm that combines dynamical decoupling with adiabatic evolution.},

	title = {Multi-pass guided atomic {Sagnac} interferometer for high-performance rotation sensing},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03446},
	abstract = {Matter wave interferometry with atoms propagating in a guiding potential is expected to provide compact, scalable and precise inertial sensing. However, a rotation sensing device based on the Sagnac effect with atoms guided in a ring has not yet been implemented despite continuous efforts during the last two decades. Here we discuss some intrinsic effects that limit the coherence in such a device and propose a scheme that overcomes these limitations and enables a multi-pass guiding Sagnac interferometer with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on a chip in a ring potential. We analyze crucial dephasing effects: potential roughness, phase diffusion due to atom-atom interactions and number uncertainty, and phase fluctuations. Owing to the recent progress in achieving high momentum beam splitting, creating smooth guides, and manipulating the matter-wavepacket propagation, guided interferometry can be implemented within the coherence time allowed by phase diffusion. Despite the lower particle flux in a guided Sagnac ring and the miniaturization of the interferometer, the estimated sensitivity, for reasonable and practical realizations of an atom-chip based gyroscope, is comparable to that of free-space interferometers, reaching \${\textbackslash}text\{45\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{nrad\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}text\{-1\}\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{Hz\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}text\{-1/2\}\}\$. A significant improvement over the state-of-the-art free-space gyrocope sensitivities can be envisioned by using thermal atoms instead of a BEC, whereby the interferometer can be operated in a continuous fashion with the coherence limited by the scattering rate of the atoms with the background gas. Taking into account the sensitivity per length of the interferometer as the figure of merit, our configuration is expected to deliver an improvement of more than 4 orders of magnitude over the-state-of-the-art free-space gyroscopes for a BEC, and 6 orders of magnitude for thermal atoms.},

	abstract = {The extreme miniaturization of a cold-atom interferometer accelerometer requires the development of novel technologies and architectures for the interferometer subsystems. We describe several component technologies and a laser system architecture to enable a path to such miniaturization. We developed a custom, compact titanium vacuum package containing a microfabricated grating chip for a tetrahedral grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT) using a single cooling beam. The vacuum package is integrated into the optomechanical design of a compact cold-atom sensor head with fixed optical components. In addition, a multichannel laser system driven by a single seed laser has been implemented with time-multiplexed frequency shifting using single sideband modulators, reducing the number of optical channels connected to the sensor head. This laser system architecture is compatible with a highly miniaturized photonic integrated circuit approach, and by demonstrating atom-interferometer operation with this laser system, we show feasibility for the integrated photonic approach. In the compact sensor head, sub-Doppler cooling in the GMOT produces 15 uK temperatures, which can operate at a 20 Hz data rate for the atom interferometer sequence. After validating atomic coherence with Ramsey interferometry, we demonstrate a light-pulse atom interferometer in a gravimeter configuration without vibration isolation for 10 Hz measurement cycle rate and T = 0 - 4.5 ms interrogation time, resulting in \${\textbackslash}Delta\$g / g = 2.0e-6.

These sidebands are controlled independently in frequency, phase, and power using standard rf components. Our laser source exhibits improved rejection of parasitic sidebands compared to those based on phase modulators, which generate large systematic shifts in atom interferometers. We measure the influence of residual laser lines on an atom-interferometric gravimeter and show agreement with a theoretical model. We estimate a reduction of the systematic shift by two orders of magnitude compared to previous architectures, and reach a long-term sensitivity of 15 ng on the gravitational acceleration with an interrogation time of only T = 20 ms.

In trying to solve the measurement problem of the quantum mechanics (QM), different interpretations were proposed, each one coming with a particular ontology. However, only one interpretation paid explicit attention to the contradiction mentioned above. This interpretation was proposed by S. Gao who named it random discontinuous motion (RDM), because it assumes the existence of a particle that jumps from place to place at random. The particle carries all the physical properties of the respective type of particle, mass, charge, magnetic momentum, etc. It jumps under the control of a so called instantaneous condition about which Gao did not give details so far.

If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0{\textless}ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

	abstract = {Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices are nowadays starting to become available to the final user, hence potentially allowing to show the quantum speedups predicted by the quantum information theory. However, before implementing any quantum algorithm, it is crucial to have at least a partial or possibly full knowledge on the type and amount of noise affecting the quantum machine. Here, by generalizing quantum generative adversarial learning from quantum states (Q-GANs) to quantum operations/superoperators/channels (here named as SuperQGANs), we propose a very promising framework to characterize noise in a realistic quantum device, even in the case of spatially and temporally correlated noise (memory channels) affecting quantum circuits. The key idea is to learn about the noise by mimicking it in a way that one cannot distinguish between the real (to be sensed) and the fake (generated) one. We find that, when applied to the benchmarking case of Pauli channels, the SuperQGAN protocol is able to learn the associated error rates even in the case of spatially and temporally correlated noise. Moreover, we also show how to employ it for quantum metrology applications. We believe our SuperQGANs pave the way for new hybrid quantum-classical machine learning protocols for a better characterization and control of the current and future unavoidably noisy quantum devices.},

Many of these tools are not limited to single qubits, but extend to composite Hilbert spaces consisting of coupled superconducting qubits and harmonic (or weakly anharmonic) modes. The library provides an extensive suite of methods for estimating qubit coherence times due to a variety of commonly considered noise channels. While all functionality of \${\textbackslash}textbf\{scqubits\}\$ can be accessed programatically, the package also implements GUI-like widgets that, with a few clicks can help users both create relevant Python objects, as well as explore their properties through various plots. When applicable, the library harnesses the computing power of multiple cores via multiprocessing. \${\textbackslash}textbf\{scqubits\}\$ further exposes a direct interface to the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) package, allowing the user to efficiently leverage QuTiP's proven capabilities for simulating time evolution.},

	abstract = {Exploiting the tension between the two dynamics of quantum theory (QT) or the so-called "measurement problem" of QT within a modified version of Wigner's Friend thought experiment, we point out that two different descriptions of Friend's lab by two different observers, Wigner and his Student, applying the same textbook QT can lead to inconsistency in observed probabilities. To avoid such inconsistent predictions of QT, we hypothesize two distinct solutions inspired by the perspectives of Wigner and Student, which we term as "Absoluteness of measurement (AoM)", and "Non-absoluteness of measurement (NoM)". To test the validity of these two perceptions in an operational approach, we construct an extended Wigner's Friend scenario and probe two sets of empirical probabilities inferred from these two perceptions without assuming the details of the experiment. We show that the set of probabilities obtainable for NoM is strictly larger than the set obtainable for AoM. We then further extend our scenario for two spatially separated Friends and propose an operational task with a suitable figure of merit to single out quantum correlations achievable with NoM but cannot be achieved using AoM. Notably, the optimal value of the figure of merit in QT with AoM is the same as in classical theory. We also analyze whether different interpretations of QT are compatible with these two perceptions and provide consistent predictions or not. Finally, we point out that the recent no-go theorems of QT provided by Frauchiger-Renner [Nat. Commun. 9, 3711 (2018)], by Brukner [Entropy 20, 350 (2018)], and by K.W. Bong et al., [Nat.

However, most of their sensing protocols rely on the application of bias magnetic fields, preventing their usage in zero- or low-field experiments. We overcome this limitation by exploiting the full spin \$S=1\$ nature of the NV center, allowing us to detect nuclear spin signals at zero- and low-field with a linearly polarized microwave field. As conventional dynamical decoupling protocols fail in this regime, we develop new robust pulse sequences and optimized pulse pairs, which allow us to sense temperature and weak AC magnetic fields and achieve an efficient decoupling from environmental noise. The sensing scheme is applicable to common NV center based setups and opens new frontiers for the application of NV centers as magnetic field sensors in the zero- and low-field regime.},

	title = {Quantum control of nuclear spin qubits in a rapidly rotating diamond},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12577},
	abstract = {Nuclear spins in certain solids couple weakly to their environment, making them attractive candidates for quantum information processing and inertial sensing. When coupled to the spin of an optically-active electron, nuclear spins can be rapidly polarized, controlled and read via lasers and radiofrequency fields. Possessing coherence times of several milliseconds at room temperature, nuclear spins hosted by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond are thus intriguing systems to observe how classical physical rotation at quantum timescales affects a quantum system. Unlocking this potential is hampered by precise and inflexible constraints on magnetic field strength and alignment in order to optically induce nuclear polarization, which restricts the scope for further study and applications. In this work, we demonstrate optical nuclear spin polarization and rapid quantum control of nuclear spins in a diamond physically rotating at \$1{\textbackslash},\$kHz, faster than the nuclear spin coherence time. Free from the need to maintain strict field alignment, we are able to measure and control nuclear spins in hitherto inaccessible regimes, such as in the presence of a large, time-varying magnetic field that makes an angle of more than \$100{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ to the nitrogen-lattice vacancy axis. The field induces spin mixing between the electron and nuclear states of the qubits, decoupling them from oscillating rf fields. We are able to demonstrate that coherent spin state control is possible at any point of the rotation, and even for up to six rotation periods. We combine continuous dynamical decoupling with quantum feedforward control to eliminate decoherence induced by imperfect mechanical rotation. Our work liberates a previously inaccessible degree of freedom of the NV nuclear spin, unlocking new approaches to quantum control and rotation sensing.},

	abstract = {L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to an underdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described in compressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of its algorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of a sparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, where sparse representation is sought to recover human identities from very high-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facial disguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is a linear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability for large-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classical convex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). The new convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-critical applications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to validate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against several popular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy, FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peer evaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.},

Being able to image such signals passively and remotely at the same time is of high importance, to measure without invasive disruption of the system under study or the signal itself. A new approach to achieve this utilises point defects in solid state materials, in particular nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond. Acting as a high density array of independent sensors, addressable opto-electronically and highly sensitive to factors including temperature and magnetic field, these are ideally suited to microscopic widefield imaging. In this work we demonstrate such imaging of signals from a microscopic lithographically patterned circuit at the micrometer scale. Using a new type of lock-in amplifier camera, we demonstrate sub-millisecond (up to 3500 frames-per-second) spatially resolved recovery of AC and pulsed electrical current signals, without aliasing or undersampling. Finally, we demonstrate as a proof of principle the recovery of synthetic signals replicating the exact form of signals in a biological neural network: the hippocampus of a mouse.},

This substantially improved output signal is due to a device design with a strongly decoupled drain reservoir from the sensor dot, mitigating negative feedback effects of conventional sensors.

	abstract = {The world is composed by events. We can sense the changes of events directly by our five senses or indirectly by using the measurement equipment and tools. If in a closed system including the observer no changes are sensed, no time passes and if even a very small change is sensed, time passes. It means that the time is not a real degree of freedom and can be only understood through the concept of changes in events. The events can be considered as relata and their mutual or multiple interactions can be considered as relation. Causality can be sensed if one relata creates a change in the other relata and in consequence the passage of time can be sensed. These two relates are connected to each other by a causal world line. If two relates are connected by a timelike curve theoretically, but they cannot make change in each other, one relata has only a priority in occurrence respect to other (time precedence), and in consequence, one can omit the past non-casual events from the casual world line. In addition, in causality relation, we should consider more than one causal world line due to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and its probabilistic nature (superposition principle). Therefore, at Planck scale, more than one casual world line should be assigned to the relation between two casual events when we want to study the dynamic of spacetime. It means that no kinematic state can be considered at Planck scale and a quantum spacetime manifold (QSTM) should be only assigned to the casual world line, from beginning. The quantum field operators and the particles are assigned to the point of the QSTM in Planck scale and in consequence, the physical theories are background dependent at the scale.},

	abstract = {The recurrent neural network with the long short-term memory cell (LSTM-NN) is employed to simulate the long-time dynamics of open quantum system. Particularly, the bootstrap resampling method is applied in the LSTM-NN construction and prediction, which provides a Monte-Carlo approach in the estimation of forecasting confidence interval. In this bootstrap-based LSTM-NN approach, a large number of LSTM-NNs are constructed under the resampling of time-series data sequences that were obtained from the early-stage quantum evolution given by numerically-exact multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method. The built LSTM-NN ensemble is used for the reliable propagation of the long-time quantum dynamics, and the forecasting uncertainty that partially reflects the reliability of the LSTM-NN prediction is given at the same time. The long-time quantum dissipative dynamics simulated by the current bootstrap-based LSTM-NN approach is highly consistent with the exact quantum dynamics results. This demonstrates that the LSTM-NN prediction combined with the bootstrap approach is a practical and powerful tool to propagate the long-time quantum dynamics of open systems with high accuracy and low computational cost.},

To achieve the optimization for L0-RBCS, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid system consisting of a quantum machine and a classical digital processor. Because forming a densely-connected network on a quantum machine is required for solving this problem, the coherent Ising machine (CIM) is one of suitable quantum machines for composing this hybrid system. To evaluate theoretically the performance of the CIM-classical hybrid system, a truncated Wigner stochastic differential equation (W-SDE) is obtained from the master equation for the density operator of the network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators, and macroscopic equations are derived from the W-SDE using statistical mechanics. We show that the system performance in principle approaches the theoretical limit of compressed sensing and in practical situations this hybrid system can exceed L1-RBCS's estimation accuracy.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We then employ the attained samples from minimizing all corresponding (different) QUBOs to estimate the solution of the problem of binary compressive sensing. Our experiments, on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum processor, demonstrated that the proposed ensemble scheme is notably less sensitive to the calibration of the penalty parameter that controls the trade-off between the feasibility and sparsity of recoveries.},

But an emerging class of quantum sensors that use Rydberg electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) to detect rf electric fields have yet to reach the SQL. In this work we prove that this discrepancy is due to fundamental limitations in the EIT probing mechanism. We derive the optimum sensitivity of a three-level quantum sensor based on EIT, or more generally coherent spectroscopy, and compare this to the SQL. We apply a minimal set of assumptions, while allowing strong probing fields, thermal broadening, and large optical depth. We derive the optimal laser intensities and optical depth, providing specific guidelines for sensitive operation under common experimental conditions. Clear boundaries of performance are established, revealing that ladder-EIT can not achieve the SQL due to unavoidable absorption loss. The results may be applied to any EIT-based quantum sensor, but we particularly emphasize our results' importance to the growing field of Rydberg quantum sensing.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12589v1},
	abstract = {Long-range correlated errors can severely impact the performance of NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Characterizing these errors is important for improving the performance of these devices, via calibration and error correction, and to ensure correct interpretation of the results. We propose a compressed sensing method for detecting two-qubit correlated dephasing errors, assuming only that the correlations are sparse (i.e., at most s pairs of qubits have correlated errors, where s {\textless}{\textless} n(n-1)/2, and n is the total number of qubits). In particular, our method can detect long-range correlations between any two qubits in the system (i.e., the correlations are not restricted to be geometrically local). Our method is highly scalable: it requires as few as m = O(s log n) measurement settings, and efficient classical postprocessing based on convex optimization. In addition, when m = O(s log{\textasciicircum}4(n)), our method is highly robust to noise, and has sample complexity O(max(n,s){\textasciicircum}2 log{\textasciicircum}4(n)), which can be compared to conventional methods that have sample complexity O(n{\textasciicircum}3). Thus, our method is advantageous when the correlations are sufficiently sparse, that is, when s {\textless} O(n{\textasciicircum}(3/2) / log{\textasciicircum}2(n)). Our method also performs well in numerical simulations on small system sizes, and has some resistance to state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. The key ingredient in our method is a new type of compressed sensing measurement, which works by preparing entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHZ states) on random subsets of qubits, and measuring their decay rates with high precision.},

The class of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics in this setup is represented by an elliptope inscribed in a non-signaling cube. The class of correlations allowed by local hidden-variable theories is represented by a tetrahedron inscribed in this elliptope. We extend this analysis to pairs of particles of arbitrary spin. The class of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics is still represented by the elliptope; the subclass of those allowed by local hidden-variable theories by polyhedra with increasing numbers of vertices and facets that get closer and closer to the elliptope. We use these results to advocate for an interpretation of quantum mechanics like Bub's. Probabilities and expectation values are primary in this interpretation. They are determined by inner products of vectors in Hilbert space. Such vectors do not themselves represent what is real in the quantum world. They encode families of probability distributions over values of different sets of observables. As in classical theory, these values ultimately represent what is real in the quantum world. Hilbert space puts constraints on possible combinations of such values, just as Minkowski space-time puts constraints on possible spatio-temporal constellations of events. Illustrating how generic such constraints are, the equation for the elliptope derived in this paper is a general constraint on correlation coefficients that can be found in older literature on statistics and probability theory. Yule (1896) already stated the constraint. De Finetti (1937) already gave it a geometrical interpretation.},

The strategy is to use the unsupervised TN machine learning algorithm to obtain the entangled state \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ that describes the probability distribution of a huge amount of classical information considered to be communicated. To transfer a specific piece of information with \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$, our proposal is to encode such information in the separable state with the minimal distance to the measured state \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Phi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ that is obtained by partially measuring on \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ in a designed way. To this end, a measuring protocol analogous to the compressed sensing with neural-network machine learning is suggested, where the measurements are designed to minimize uncertainty of information from the probability distribution given by \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Phi {\textbackslash}rangle\$. In this way, those who have \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Phi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ can reliably access the information by simply measuring on \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Phi {\textbackslash}rangle\$. We propose q-sparsity to characterize the sparsity of quantum states and the efficiency of the quantum communications by TNCS. The high q-sparsity is essentially due to the fact that the TN states describing nicely the probability distribution obey the area law of entanglement entropy. Testing on realistic datasets (hand-written digits and fashion images), TNCS is shown to possess high efficiency and accuracy, where the security of communications is guaranteed by the fundamental quantum principles.},

Here, we demonstrate a new approach that combines quantum engineering with single-molecule biophysics to immobilize individual proteins and DNA molecules on the surface of a bulk diamond crystal that hosts coherent nitrogen vacancy qubit sensors. Our thin (sub-5 nm) functionalization architecture provides precise control over protein adsorption density and results in near-surface qubit coherence approaching 100 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}s.

            If quantum information processors are to fulfill their potential, the diverse errors that affect them must be understood and suppressed. But errors typically fluctuate over time, and the most widely used tools for characterizing them assume static error modes and rates. This mismatch can cause unheralded failures, misidentified error modes, and wasted experimental effort. Here, we demonstrate a spectral analysis technique for resolving time dependence in quantum processors. Our method is fast, simple, and statistically sound. It can be applied to time-series data from any quantum processor experiment. We use data from simulations and trapped-ion qubit experiments to show how our method can resolve time dependence when applied to popular characterization protocols, including randomized benchmarking, gate set tomography, and Ramsey spectroscopy. In the experiments, we detect instability and localize its source, implement drift control techniques to compensate for this instability, and then demonstrate that the instability has been suppressed.},

Since the first experimental realization of such a widefield NV microscope in 2010, the technology has seen rapid development and demonstration of applications in various areas across condensed matter physics, geoscience and biology. This Perspective analyzes the strengths and shortcomings of widefield NV microscopy in order to identify the most promising applications and guide future development. We begin with a brief review of quantum sensing with ensembles of NV centers, and the experimental implementation of widefield NV microscopy. We then compare this technology to alternative microscopy techniques commonly employed to probe magnetic materials and charge flow distributions. Current limitations in spatial resolution, measurement accuracy, magnetic sensitivity, operating conditions and ease of use, are discussed. Finally, we identify the technological advances that solve the aforementioned limitations, and argue that their implementation would result in a practical, accessible, high-throughput widefield NV microscope.},

While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06569},
	abstract = {The error rates of quantum devices are orders of magnitude higher than what is needed to run most quantum applications. To close this gap, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using several physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction circuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is extracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify and correct errors in real time, which is required to use feedback implemented in quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware decoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have relied on offline decoding. To enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT-- a Lightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts-- First, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a Look-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time. Second, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error events by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on any operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurement, and the number of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. It needs {\textless}7\% logic on off-the-shelf FPGAs that allows it to be easily integrated alongside the control and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of few nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs (CLUTs) to reduce the memory needed by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that not all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most probable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148 MB to 1.38 MB) without degrading accuracy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06349},
	abstract = {Present protocols of criticality enhanced sensing with open quantum sensors assume direct measurement of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted to the environment, thereby omitting potentially valuable information. Here we propose a protocol for criticality enhanced sensing via continuous observation of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a scaling theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system and environment state at a dissipative critical point. We demonstrate that it obeys universal scaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior governed by the underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the standard quantum limit and can in principle satuarate the Heisenberg limit. To harness such advantageous scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based on continuous detection of the emitted quanta. In such a scheme a single interrogation corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory of the open system evolving under the non-unitary dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed and the back-action of the continuous measurement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the associated precision scaling significantly exceeds that based on direct measurement of the critical steady state, thereby establishing the metrological value of detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative criticality. We illustrate our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the open Rabi model, a paradigmatic model for the study of dissipative phase transition with finite components. Our protocol is applicable to diverse open quantum sensors permitting continuous readout, and may find applications at the frontier of quantum sensing such as human-machine interface, magnetic diagnosis of heart disease and zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance.},

	abstract = {Most research in quantum computing today is performed against simulations of quantum computers rather than true quantum computers. Simulating a quantum computer entails implementing all of the unitary operators corresponding to the quantum gates as tensors. For high numbers of qubits, performing tensor multiplications for these simulations becomes quite expensive, since \$N\$-qubit gates correspond to \$2{\textasciicircum}\{N\}\$-dimensional tensors. One way to accelerate such a simulation is to use field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware to efficiently compute the matrix multiplications. Though FPGAs can efficiently perform tensor multiplications, they are memory bound, having relatively small block random access memory. One way to potentially reduce the memory footprint of a quantum computing system is to represent it as a tensor network; tensor networks are a formalism for representing compositions of tensors wherein economical tensor contractions are readily identified. Thus we explore tensor networks as a means to reducing the memory footprint of quantum computing systems and broadly accelerating simulations of such systems.},

	abstract = {Central neurons have multiple types of voltage-dependent potassium channels, whose activation during action potentials shapes spike width and whose activation and inactivation at subthreshold voltages modulate firing frequency. We characterized the voltage-dependent potassium currents flowing during the action potentials of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons and examined the susceptibility of the underlying channel types to inactivation at subthreshold voltages. Using acutely dissociated neurons that permitted rapid voltage clamp, action potentials recorded previously were used as the command voltage waveform, and individual components of potassium current were identified by pharmacological sensitivity. The overall voltage-dependent potassium current in the neurons could be split into three major components based on pharmacology and kinetics during step voltage pulses: ID (fast activating, slowly inactivating, and sensitive to 4-aminopyridine at 30 μm),IA (fast activating, fast inactivating, and sensitive to 4-aminopyridine at 3 mm), andIK (slowly activating, noninactivating, and sensitive to external TEA at 3–25 mm). The potassium current during the action potential was composed of approximately equal contributions of ID andIA, with a negligible contribution ofIK. ID andIA had nearly identical trajectories of activation and deactivation during the action potential. BothIA and ID showed steady-state inactivation at subthreshold voltages, but maximal inactivation at such voltages was incomplete for both currents. Because of the major contribution of both IDand IA to spike repolarization, it is likely that modulation or partial inactivation at subthreshold voltages of either current can influence spike timing with minimal effect on spike width.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying {\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ {\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar} for some constant C/sub M/{\textgreater}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O({\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to {\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing is a new concept in signal processing where one seeks to minimize the number of measurements to be taken from signals while still retaining the information necessary to approximate them well. The ideas have their origins in certain abstract results from functional analysis and approximation theory by Kashin [23] but were recently brought into the forefront by the work of Cand`es, Romberg and Tao [7, 5, 6] and Donoho [9] who constructed concrete algorithms and showed their promise in application. There remain several fundamental questions on both the theoretical and practical side of compressed sensing. This paper is primarily concerned about one of these theoretical issues revolving around just how well compressed sensing can approximate a given signal from a given budget of ﬁxed linear measurements, as compared to adaptive linear measurements. More precisely, we consider discrete signals x ∈ IRN , allocate n {\textless} N linear measurements of x, and we describe the range of k for which these measurements encode enough information to recover x in the sense of p to the accuracy of best k-term approximation. We also consider the problem of having such accuracy only with high probability.},

	abstract = {We employ an algebraic procedure based on quantum mechanics to propose a `quantum number theory' (QNT) as a possible extension of the `classical number theory'. We built our QNT by defining pure quantum number operators (\$q\$-numbers) of a Hilbert space that generate classical numbers (\$c\$-numbers) belonging to discrete Euclidean spaces. To start with this formalism, we define a 2-component natural \$q\$-number \${\textbackslash}textbf\{N\}\$, such that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{N\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}equiv N\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + N\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$, satisfying a Heisenberg-Dirac algebra, which allows to generate a set of natural \$c\$-numbers \$n {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$. A probabilistic interpretation of QNT is then inferred from this representation. Furthermore, we define a 3-component integer \$q\$-number \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Z\}\$, such that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}equiv Z\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + Z\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + Z\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and obeys a Lie algebra structure. The eigenvalues of each \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Z\}\$ component generate a set of classical integers \$m {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textbackslash}cup {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\} = {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\} {\textbackslash}setminus {\textbackslash}\{0{\textbackslash}\}\$, albeit all components do not generate \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ simultaneously. We interpret the eigenvectors of the \$q\$-numbers as `\$q\$-number state vectors' (QNSV), which form multidimensional orthonormal basis sets useful to describe state-vector superpositions defined here as qu\$n\$its. To interconnect QNSV of different dimensions, associated to the same \$c\$-number, we propose a quantum mapping operation to relate distinct Hilbert subspaces, and its structure can generate a subset \$W {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$, the field of non-zero rationals. In the present description, QNT is related to quantum computing theory and allows dealing with nontrivial computations in high dimensions.},

Read-out was achieved via a weakly coupled second spin in the tunnel junction that acted as a quantum sensor. We simultaneously and independently drove the sensor and remote spins by two radio frequency voltages in double resonance experiments, which provides a path to quantum-coherent multi-spin manipulation in customized spin structures on surfaces.},

	abstract = {Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms require novel paradigms of error mitigation. To obtain noise-robust quantum computers, each logical qubit is equipped with hundreds or thousands of physical qubits. However, it is not possible to use memory-consuming techniques for current quantum devices having at most hundreds or at best thousands of physical qubits on their own. For specific problems, valid quantum states have a unique structure as in the case of Fock states and W-states where the Hamming weight is fixed, and the evolution takes place in a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. With this pre-knowledge, some errors can be detected in the course of the evolution of the circuit, by filtering the states not obeying the pattern through post-selection. In this paper, we present mid-circuit post-selection schemes for frequently used encodings such as one-hot, binary, gray, and domain-wall encoding. For the particular subspace of one-hot states, we propose a method that works by compressing the full Hilbert space to a smaller subspace, allowing projecting to the desired subspace without using any ancilla qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz algorithm. Our method is particularly suitable for the currently available hardware, where measuring and resetting is possible, but classical control conditional operators are not.},

Our new bounds are not only more generally applicable than those in the literature -- for example, they apply to systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians and/or Lindblad operators, and to infinite-dimensional systems such as oscillators -- but are also tighter in the settings where previous bounds do apply. We derive our bounds directly from the stochastic master equation describing the system, without needing to discretise its time evolution. We also use our results to investigate how sensitive a single detection system can be to signals with different time dependences. We demonstrate that the sensitivity bandwidth is related to the quantum fluctuations of \${\textbackslash}partial H/{\textbackslash}partial g\$, illustrating how 'non-classical' states can enhance the range of signals that a system is sensitive to, even when they cannot increase its peak sensitivity.},

Contributions to the spin noise include one-body and three-body losses and shearing of the projection noise distribution, due to competition of ferromagnetic contact interactions and quadratic Zeeman shifts. Nonetheless, the fully-coherent nature of the single-domain, ultracold two-body interactions allows the system to escape the coherence vs. density trade-off that imposes an energy resolution limit on traditional spin-precession sensors. We predict that other Bose-condensed alkalis, especially the antiferromagnetic Na-23, can further improve the energy resolution of this method.},

Moreover, the structure of the software allows an easy generalization of basic experiments to more sophisticated ones, as it includes all the libraries required for the numerical simulation of generic spin systems. In order to make the program easily accessible to a large user base, we developed a user-friendly graphical interface and fully-detailed documentation. Lastly, we portray several examples of the execution of the code that demonstrate the potential of NMR/NQR for the scopes of quantum control and quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {Stable quantum memories that capable of storing quantum information for long time scales are an essential building block for an array of potential applications. The long memory time are usually achieved via dynamical decoupling technique involving decoupling of the memory states from its local environment. However, because this process is strongly limited by the errors in the pulses, an noise-protected scheme remains challenging in the field of quantum memories. Here we propose a scheme to design a noise-resisted \$\${\textbackslash}pi\$\$pulse, which features high fidelity exceeding \$\$99.9{\textbackslash}\%\$\$under realistic situations. Using this \$\${\textbackslash}pi\$\$pulse we can generate different dynamical decoupling sequences that preserve high fidelity for long time scales. The versatility, robustness, and potential scalability of this method may allow for various applications in quantum memories technology.},

The ideas and analyses of Einstein and Bohr through to more recent approaches to objective realism are discussed. We briefly describe measurement induced projections, the guided wave interpretation, many-universes, consistent histories, and modal theories. These earlier interpretations are compared with OQFT. We argue that this approach is compatible both with Bohr's quantum complementarity, and Einstein's objective realism.},

	title = {On reconstruction of the {Hilbert} space from conceptual variables},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12168},
	abstract = {In [1] the general problem of deriving the Hilbert space formulation in quantum theory is discussed from the point of view of conceptual variables. A conceptual variable is any variable defined by a person or by a group of persons. These variables may be inaccessible, i.e., impossible to assign numerical value to either by experiments or by other means, or accessible. As one basic assumption, a group K of actions on a space of an inaccessible variable is defined, and accessible functions of this variable are introduced. When such a function is permissible, a term that is precisely defined here, a group of actions G can be introduced on the range of the function. In general in this paper only the existence of the group G is assumed. By using group representation theory on the groups defined on a class of accessible variables, basic Hilbert space formalism is restored under the assumption that the observator or the set of observators has two maximally accessible variables in his (their) mind(s). Operators are connected to each variable, and in the discrete case the possible values of the variables are given by the eigenvalues of the operators. The entire approach may be connected to a general epistemic interpretation of quantum theory. In this paper the main results from [1] are made more precise and more general. It turns out that the conditions of the main theorem there can be weakened in two essential ways: 1) No measurements need to be assumed, so the result is also applicable to general decision situations; 2) States can have arbitrary phase factors. Some consequences of the main result are also briefly discussed here.},

	abstract = {We introduce an enhanced technique for strong classical simulation of quantum circuits which combines the `sum-of-stabilisers' method with an automated simplification strategy based on the ZX-calculus. Recently it was shown that quantum circuits can be classically simulated by expressing the non-stabiliser gates in a circuit as magic state injections and decomposing them in chunks of 2-6 states at a time, obtaining sums of (efficiently-simulable) stabiliser states with many fewer terms than the naive approach. We adapt these techniques from the original setting of Clifford circuits with magic state injection to generic ZX-diagrams and show that, by interleaving this "chunked" decomposition with a ZX-calculus-based simplification strategy, we can obtain stabiliser decompositions that are many orders of magnitude smaller than existing approaches. We illustrate this technique to perform exact norm calculations (and hence strong simulation) on the outputs of random 50- and 100-qubit Clifford+T circuits with up to 70 T-gates as well as a family of hidden shift circuits previously considered by Bravyi and Gosset with over 1000 T-gates.},

	abstract = {The impact of measurement imperfections on quantum metrology protocols has been largely ignored, even though these are inherent to any sensing platform in which the detection process exhibits noise that neither can be eradicated, nor translated onto the sensing stage and interpreted as decoherence. In this work, we approach this issue in a systematic manner. Focussing firstly on pure states, we demonstrate how the form of the quantum Fisher information must be modified to account for noisy detection, and propose tractable methods allowing for its approximate evaluation. We then show that in canonical scenarios involving \$N\$ probes with local measurements undergoing readout noise, the optimal sensitivity dramatically changes its behaviour depending whether global or local control operations are allowed to counterbalance measurement imperfections. In the former case, we prove that the ideal sensitivity (e.g. the Heisenberg scaling) can always be recovered in the asymptotic \$N\$ limit, while in the latter the readout noise fundamentally constrains the quantum enhancement of sensitivity to a constant factor. We illustrate our findings with an example of an NV-centre measured via the repetitive readout procedure, as well as schemes involving spin-1/2 probes with bit-flip errors affecting their two-outcome measurements, for which we find the input states and control unitary operations sufficient to attain the ultimate asymptotic precision.},

	abstract = {Quantum sensors based on spin defect ensembles have seen rapid development in recent years, with a wide array of target applications. Historically, these sensors have used optical methods to prepare or read out quantum states. However, these methods are limited to optically-polarizable spin defects, and the spin ensemble size is typically limited by the available optical power or acceptable optical heat load. We demonstrate a solid-state sensor employing a non-optical state preparation technique, which harnesses thermal population imbalances induced by the defect's zero-field splitting. Readout is performed using the recently-demonstrated microwave cavity readout technique, resulting in a sensor architecture that is entirely non-optical and broadly applicable to all solid-state paramagnetic defects with a zero-field splitting. The implementation in this work uses Cr\${\textasciicircum}\{3+\}\$ defects in a sapphire (Al\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$) crystal and a simple microwave architecture where the host crystal also serves as the high quality-factor resonator. This approach yields a near-unity filling factor and high single-spin-photon coupling, producing a magnetometer with a broadband sensitivity of 9.7 pT/\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}text\{Hz\}\}\$.},

Proposals for compositional interpretation of extended Lambek Calculus in the compact closed category of FVect and linear maps have been made, but in these proposals the syntax-semantics mapping ignores the control modalities, effectively restricting their role to the syntax. Our aim is to turn the modalities into first-class citizens of the vectorial interpretation. Building on the directional density matrix semantics, we extend the interpretation of the type system with an extra spin density matrix space. The interpretation of proofs then results in ambiguous derivations being tensored with orthogonal spin states. Our method introduces a way of simultaneously representing co-existing interpretations of ambiguous utterances, and provides a uniform framework for the integration of lexical and derivational ambiguity.},

We provide a detailed study of the transport efficiency for different accelerations and lattice depths and find that the transport efficiency is mainly limited by the potential depth along the direction of gravity.

Moreover, the important role of non-Markovianity as a resource for quantum teleportation is discussed. Considering the limitations imposed by decoherence and the subsequent mixedness of the resource state, we find that our results may solve important challenges in realizing faithful teleportation over long distances.},

	abstract = {Tensor cores, along with tensor processing units, represent a new form of hardware acceleration specifically designed for deep neural network calculations in artificial intelligence applications. Tensor cores provide extraordinary computational speed and energy efficiency, but with the caveat that they were designed for tensor contractions (matrix-matrix multiplications) using only low-precision floating point operations. In spite of this, we demonstrate how tensor cores can be applied with high efficiency to the challenging and numerically sensitive problem of quantum-based Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, which requires highly accurate electronic structure optimizations and conservative force evaluations. The interatomic forces are calculated on-the-fly from an electronic structure that is obtained from a generalized deep neural network, where the computational structure naturally takes advantage of the exceptional processing power of the tensor cores and allows for high performance in excess of 100 Tflops on the tensor cores of a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Stable molecular dynamics trajectories are generated using the framework of extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, which combines computational efficiency with long-term stability, even when using approximate charge relaxations and force evaluations that are limited in accuracy by the numerically noisy conditions caused by the low precision tensor core floating-point operations. A canonical ensemble simulation scheme is also presented, where the additional numerical noise in the calculated forces is absorbed into a Langevin-like dynamics.},

The CS algorithm is implemented using two different operator bases, namely, the standard Pauli basis and the Pauli-error basis. We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the CS algorithm is significantly better in the Pauli-error basis, where the constructed \${\textbackslash}chi\$ matrix is maximally sparse. We compare the standard least square (LS) optimization QPT method with the CS-QPT method and observe that, provided an appropriate basis is chosen, the CS-QPT method performs significantly better as compared to the LS-QPT method. In all the cases considered, we obtained experimental fidelities greater than 0.9 from a reduced data set, which was approximately five to six times smaller in size than a full data set. We also experimentally characterized the reduced dynamics of a two-qubit subsystem embedded in a three-qubit system, and used the CS-QPT method to characterize processes corresponding to the evolution of two-qubit states under various \$J\$-coupling interactions.},

	abstract = {Ensembles of solid state defects in diamond make promising quantum sensors with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. The inhomogeneous broadening and drive amplitude variations across such ensembles have differing impacts on the sensitivity depending on the sensing scheme used, adding to the challenge of choosing the optimal sensing scheme for a particular sensing regime. In this work, we numerically investigate and compare the predicted sensitivity of schemes based on continuous-wave (CW) optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy, pi-pulse ODMR and Ramsey interferometry for sensing using nitrogen-vacancy centers in the low-frequency ({\textless}10 kHz) range typical for signals from biological sources. We show that inhomogeneous broadening has the strongest impact on the sensitivity of Ramsey interferometry, and drive amplitude variations least impact the sensitivity of CW ODMR, with all methods constrained by the Rabi frequency. Based on our results, we can identify three different regions of interest. For inhomogeneous broadening less than 0.3 MHz, typical of diamonds used in state of the art sensing experiments, Ramsey interferometry yields the highest sensitivity. In the regime where inhomogeneous broadening is greater than 0.3 MHz, such as for standard optical grade diamonds or in miniaturized integrated devices, drive amplitude variations determine the optimal protocol to use. For low to medium drive amplitude variations, the highest sensitivity is reached using pi-pulse ODMR. For high drive amplitude variations, relevant for widefield microscopic imaging, CW ODMR can yield the best sensing performance.},

The algorithm finds a set of basis vectors and their binary coefficients that precisely reconstruct the original data. The optimization for the basis vectors is performed classically, while binary coefficients are retrieved through both simulated and quantum annealing for comparison. A bias correction procedure is also presented to estimate and eliminate the error and bias introduced from the inexact reconstruction of the lossy compression for statistical data analyses. The compression algorithm is demonstrated on two different datasets of lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. The results obtained using simulated annealing show 3.5 times better compression performance than the algorithms based on a neural-network autoencoder and principal component analysis. Calculations using quantum annealing also show promising results, but performance is limited by the integrated control error of the quantum processing unit, which yields large uncertainties in the biases and coupling parameters. Hardware comparison is further studied between the previous generation D-Wave 2000Q and the current D-Wave Advantage system. Our study shows that the Advantage system is more likely to obtain low-energy solutions for the problems than the 2000Q.},

To test various hypotheses regarding collapse of wavefunctions, we propose a model system which is the quantum analogue of a classical soft-impact oscillator. We propose some alternative postulates regarding the conditions for and the result of a collapse, and obtain the implication of each on the behavior of observable quantities, which can possibly be experimentally tested.},

	abstract = {Quantum processing architectures that include multiple qubit modalities offer compelling strategies for high-fidelity operations and readout, quantum error correction, and a path for scaling to large system sizes. Such hybrid architectures have been realized for leading platforms, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. Recently, a new approach for constructing large, coherent quantum processors has emerged based on arrays of individually trapped neutral atoms. However, these demonstrations have been limited to arrays of a single atomic element where the identical nature of the atoms makes crosstalk-free control and non-demolition readout of a large number of atomic qubits challenging. Here we introduce a dual-element atom array with individual control of single rubidium and cesium atoms. We demonstrate their independent placement in arrays with up to 512 trapping sites and observe negligible crosstalk between the two elements. Furthermore, by continuously reloading one atomic element while maintaining an array of the other, we demonstrate a new continuous operation mode for atom arrays without any off-time. Our results enable avenues for ancilla-assisted quantum protocols such as quantum non-demolition measurements and quantum error correction, as well as continuously operating quantum processors and sensors.},

	abstract = {Realistic modeling of qubit systems including noise and constraints imposed by control hardware is required for performance prediction and control optimization of quantum processors. We introduce qopt, a software framework for simulating qubit dynamics and robust quantum optimal control considering common experimental situations. To this end, we model open and closed qubit systems with a focus on the simulation of realistic noise characteristics and experimental constraints. Specifically, the influence of noise can be calculated using Monte Carlo methods, effective master equations or with the efficient filter function formalism, which enables the investigation and mitigation of auto-correlated noise. In addition, limitations of control electronics including finite bandwidth effects as well as nonlinear transfer functions and drive-dependent noise can be considered. The calculation of gradients based on analytic results is implemented to facilitate the efficient optimization of control pulses. The software easily interfaces with QuTip, is published under an open source license, well-tested and features a detailed documentation.},

	abstract = {Quantum optimal control theory is becoming increasingly crucial as quantum devices become more precise, but the need to quickly optimize these systems classically remains a significant bottleneck in their operation. Here we present a new theoretical quantum control framework for much faster optimization than the state of the art by replacing standard time propagation with a product of short-time propagators, each calculated using the Magnus expansion. The derived formulas for exact series terms and their gradients, based on earlier approximations of the integrals in a simulation setting, allow us to subsume the high cost of calculating commutators and integrals as an initial overhead, thereby providing a tenfold speedup for all subsequent dynamical trajectories from control and noise sampling.},

The DQ 4-Ramsey protocol employs microwave-phase alternation across four consecutive Ramsey (4-Ramsey) measurements to isolate the desired DQ magnetic signal from any residual SQ signal induced by microwave pulse errors. In a demonstration experiment employing a 1-μm-thick N-V layer in a macroscopic diamond chip, the DQ 4-Ramsey protocol provides a volume-normalized dc magnetic sensitivity of ηV=34nTHz−1/2μm3/2 across a 125μm×125μm field of view, with about 5× less spatial variation in sensitivity across the field of view compared to a SQ measurement. The improved robustness and magnetic sensitivity homogeneity of the DQ 4-Ramsey protocol enables imaging of dynamic broadband magnetic sources such as integrated circuits and electrically active cells.},

Optically-based nuclear magnetic resonance may be possible at pressures greater than a few GPa, and offers an attractive alternative to conventional Faraday-induction based detection. Here we present AC sensing results and demonstrate synchronized readout up to 6 GPa, but find that the sensitivity is reduced due to inhomogeneities of the microwave field and pressure within the sample space. These experiments enable the possibility for all-optical high resolution magnetic resonance of nanoliter sample volumes at high pressures.},

	abstract = {Unpaired electronic spins at diamond surfaces are ubiquitous and can lead to decoherence of shallow nitrogen vacancy centers. They have been observed in several studies to date, but their exact chemical nature is still unknown. We propose a simple and reliable model to explain the existence and chemical stability of surface spins on the (100) diamond surface by means of density functional theory simulation. We find that the (111) facet, which is naturally generated at a step edge of (100) crystalline diamond surface, can topographically protect a spinful defect. Our study reveals a mechanism for annihilation of these surface spins upon annealing. We also demonstrate that the Fermi-contact term in the hyperfine coupling is not negligible between the surface spins and the surrounding nuclear spins, and thus {\textbackslash}textit\{ab initio\} simulation can be used to devise a sensing protocol where the surface spins act as reporter spins to sense nuclear spins on the surface.},

On propose dans cette Note un schéma permettant de profiter d'une architecture parallèle pour la discrétisation en temps d'une équation d'évolution aux dérivées partielles. Cette méthode, basée sur un schéma d'Euler, combine des résolutions grossières et des résolutions fines et indépendantes en temps en s'inspirant de ce qui est classique en espace. La parallélisation qui en résulte se fait dans la direction temporelle ce qui est en revanche non classique. Elle a pour principale motivation les problèmes en temps réel, d'où la terminologie proposée de «pararéel ».
The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.},
