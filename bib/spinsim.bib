	abstract = {In the present paper we consider numerical methods to solve the discrete Schrödinger equation with a time dependent Hamiltonian (motivated by problems encountered in the study of spin systems). We will consider both short-range interactions, which lead to evolution equations involving sparse matrices, and long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings show very different computational characteristics. We use Magnus integrators for time integration and employ a framework based on Leja interpolation to compute the resulting action of the matrix exponential. We consider both traditional Magnus integrators (which are extensively used for these types of problems in the literature) as well as the recently developed commutator-free Magnus integrators and implement them on modern CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) based systems. We find that GPUs can yield a significant speed-up (up to a factor of 10 in the dense case) for these types of problems. In the sparse case GPUs are only advantageous for large problem sizes and the achieved speed-ups are more modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on the GPU this advantage is rather small. In fact, none of the advantage of commutator-free methods on GPUs (and on multi-core CPUs) is due to the elimination of commutators. This has important consequences for the design of more efficient numerical methods.},

Firstly, we give the general framework of quantum metrology and the calculation of quantum Fisher information, which is the core of quantum parameter estimation. Then, we introduce the quantum interferometry with single and multiparticle states. In particular, for some typical multiparticle states, we analyze their ultimate precision limits and show how quantum entanglement could enhance the measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit.

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast 3D MRI simulator for arbitrary k-space sampling using a graphical processing unit (GPU) and demonstrate its performance by comparing simulation and experimental results in a real MRI system.Materials and Methods: A fast 3D MRI simulator using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was developed using C++ and the CUDA 8.0 platform (NVIDIA Corporation). The unique advantage of this simulator was that it could use the same pulse sequence as used in the experiment. The performance of the MRI simulator was measured using two GTX 1080 GPUs and 3D Cones sequences. The MRI simulation results for 3D non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like 3D Cones sequences using a numerical 3D phantom were compared with the experimental results obtained with a real MRI system and a real 3D phantom.Results: The performance of the MRI simulator was about 3800–4900 gigaflops for 128- to 4-shot 3D Cones sequences with 2563 voxels, which was about 60\% of the performance of the previous MRI simulator optimized for Cartesian sampling calculated for a Cartesian sampling gradient-echo sequence with 2563 voxels. The effects of the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, radio-frequency field inhomogeneity, gradient field nonlinearity, and fast repetition times on the MR images were reproduced in the simulated images as observed in the experimental images.Conclusion: The 3D MRI simulator developed for arbitrary k-space sampling optimized using GPUs is a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of advanced imaging sequences including both Cartesian and non-Cartesian k-space sampling.},

We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these computations. In the present paper, we describe SPINEVOLUTION, a highly optimized computer program that implements the new methodology. The algorithms used in the program will be described separately. Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and multi-spin systems in solids, SPINEVOLUTION is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and optimization of virtually any NMR experiment. The performance of SPINEVOLUTION was compared with that of another recently developed NMR simulation package, SIMPSON. Benchmarked on a series of examples, SPINEVOLUTION was consistently found to be orders of magnitude faster. At the time of publication, the program is available gratis for non-commercial use.},

	abstract = {The theoretical transition energies of a spin 3/2 under a combination of quadrupolar and Zeeman interactions are mapped out as a function of magnetic field. This allows us to follow the spectroscopy continuously from zero magnetic field (NQR, nuclear quadrupole resonance) through to high magnetic field (quadrupole-perturbed NMR). This calculation is made possible by a theoretical approach that makes maximum use of the angular momentum properties of the spin system. In this approach, the detailed form of the spin operators are not required, only their angular momentum quantum numbers. No commutators need be evaluated, and the method is easily coded for computer calculation. Application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules means that there are only two nonzero reduced matrix elements that are needed for a spin 3/2, and there are explicit formulae for them. In looking at the transition energies, the crucial parameter is the orientation of the quadrupole tensor to the magnetic field. If the angle is nonzero, then the quantization of the spins must shift. At zero field, the quantization is defined by the electric field gradient tensor, which is molecule-fixed at some arbitrary angle to the magnetic field. This direction of quantization must change as the magnetic field increases, to lie close to the z axis at high field. In the region where the two interactions are comparable, all the familiar rules break down and the response is highly nonlinear. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Much of the motivation for exploring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond in the past decade has been for their potential as a solid-state alternative to trapped ions for quantum computing. In this area, the NV center has exceeded expectations and even shown an unprecedented capability to perform certain quantum processing and storage operations at room temperature. The ability to operate in ambient conditions, combined with the atom-like magnetic Zeeman sensitivity, has also led to intensive investigation of NV centers as nanoscale magnetometers. Thus, aside from room-temperature solid-state quantum computers, the NV could also be used to image individual spins in biological systems, eventually leading to a new level of understanding of biomolecular interactions in living cells.},
