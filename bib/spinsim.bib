	abstract = {Using dipole and quadrupole operators as the orthogonal basis of su(3) algebra and successive Cartan decompositions, the decomposition of matrices for two coupled spin 1 systems is investigated so as to meet the requirements of some realistic quantum systems. Finally, this kind of decomposition for the ternary SWAP gate is given specifically. This method can be used to investigate the realization of two-qutrit logic gates.},
